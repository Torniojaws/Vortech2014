<a id="pos1"></a><h3>Posthumanism</h3>
<p class="cutep">
And so you awaken, a steel-cold place<br />
Strapped in a chair, without a face<br />
You recall nothing at all<br />
A faint hum and a sterile wall</p>
<p class="cutep">
Fumbling around you pace the floor<br />
But a single blue light here at all</p>
<p class="cutep">
Shout out in vain<br />
There's no one to hear your blame<br />
A solitary cell in a prison without a door</p>
<p class="cutep">
This is the new life<br />
A singular purpose for you<br />
Traverse the boundaries<br />
of what is man and what is not</p>
<p class="cutep">
And so do the walls crash down<br />
the revelation of sordid proportions<br />
A world of twisted rubble and far-gone war<br />
the debris tells who we really are</p>
<p class="cutep">
Beyond humanity there is more hope<br />
Such a fate is the final excursion of the mope<br />
A necessary evil of the future world<br />
the continued survival of the obsolete and wrong</p>
<p class="cutep">
With a growl you accept your fate<br />
The only companion here is your hate<br />
A mere beginning of your long trek<br />
But little did you know of my plans</p>
<p class="cutep">
A demigod behind it all<br />
Self-styled master of creation<br />
Under his absolute command<br />
there is no free will for anyone</p>

<a id="pos2"></a><h3>Xenomorphosis | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
&quot;Be one of first!&quot; The ad calls out for subjects<br />
A new kind of genetics project<br />
Enhancement of your biological makeup<br />
A promise of superhuman reflexes</p>
<p class="cutep">
The fine print goes unread<br />
Oblivious to the consequence<br />
Sinister plan up to highest levels<br />
Desperate act before public knowledge</p>
<p class="cutep">
The ominous glow of the sun<br />
as you stand-to in the antechamber</p>
<p class="cutep">
The call-in is swift and relentless<br />
They drag you down to the black chrome chair<br />
They strap you down lest you hurt yourself<br />
As Xenomorphosis executes</p>
<p class="cutep">
The strobe lights flash on your eyes<br />
A morphine spike snaps to your vein<br />
The mechanic device consumes your hand<br />
You feel it come clean off and re-attach</p>
<p class="cutep">
You wake up on a rainy street at night<br />
No recollection of what went on</p>
<p class="cutep">
The days go by and you're none the wiser<br />
Dreams of slithering steel and oil-drowned people</p>
<p class="cutep">
You snap awake from your horrid dreams<br />
As you freeze solid from a look at your hand</p>
<p class="cutep">
You hear a crackle within your head<br />
As the commands start to upload to the brain<br />
&quot;"No longer are you in control of yourself,<br />
Experimental Droid X-1&quot;</p>
<p class="cutep">
This is your dream made all too real<br />
Spills soil your standard issue BDUs<br />
The path is paved in human blood<br />
for the project launch is a resounding &quot;go&quot;</p>

<a id="pos3"></a><h3>Destined to Fall | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
Control is the key to life<br />
But what to do when the lock is broken<br />
Shattered hope lies all in pieces<br />
and the winds are picking up</p>
<p class="cutep">
All accept the given terms:<br />
Human life in exchange for survival<br />
Reality is altered<br />
humanity has faltered</p>
<p class="cutep">
Is that all necessary?<br />
The machine acting an emissary?<br />
Bringing about the new world order<br />
In this land of flaw and disorder</p>
<p class="cutep">
Life in a world of ashes<br />
Calls us all with open arms</p>
<p class="cutep">
Synthetic arms race of humanity<br />
What a world to live in<br />
Creation of bionic weapons<br />
Zombified subhuman waste to the suits</p>
<p class="cutep">
Project Odin their masterplan<br />
Violent mind control of cybernetic man<br />
Masked out as a means to save us all<br />
A plan ultimately causing our fall</p>
<p class="cutep">
Life in a world of ashes<br />
Calls us all with open arms<br />
Mindless we are destined to fall<br />
Violence their solution to it all<br />
Little do they care of their pawns<br />
For are they not their synthetic spawns</p>

<a id="pos4"></a><h3>Humanity: Static | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
The dawn of the threshold<br />
Awaken anew<br />
Shed the final piece of evidence<br />
of your long gone existence</p>
<p class="cutep">
It's a race for answers<br />
Question all the you see<br />
But for how long can you keep up<br />
with a product destined for failure</p>
<p class="cutep">
The truth is a whore for lies<br />
Consuming them with a zest of frenzy<br />
Expulsing all to suit the need<br />
As the betterment of mankind they feed</p>
<p class="cutep">
The fragile transmission<br />
diminishes to pure static<br />
Nothing left of their humanity<br />
From ashes they arise</p>
<p class="cutep">
Lifelines dwindle<br />
For the weak are born anew<br />
Abandoned their humanity<br />
the Biotrons walk the earth</p>
<p class="cutep">
Perversions of sickening science<br />
Insane creations of a brave new world<br />
What comes beyond humanity<br />
but a soulless drone of obscurity</p>
<p class="cutep">
Now the evidence is all in front of you<br />
It's a time for your own decision:<br />
Alone in the bonegarden?<br />
Stripped of humanity without pardon?</p>

<a id="pos5"></a><h3>The Wolves | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
The wolves watch and wait as their prey wander aimlessly<br />
heedless of what is to be, all so damning and foreboding<br />
An animalistic grin forms on their lips as they prepare themselves<br />
with a final howl at the waning sun of mankind, they launch towards the throats of men</p>
<p class="cutep">
Entities of their own creation<br />
turn against the hand that feeds<br />
A full moon is over the scene undescribable<br />
Unprovoked is the nature of their kill</p>
<p class="cutep">
A feeding frenzy turns the tide of the world<br />
Puffs of snow turn crimson and visceral<br />
Against malcreation the nature does turn<br />
Violation of evolution they churn</p>
<p class="cutep">
Now the wolves switch their attention<br />
A yellow orb eyes at your face<br />
Snarling its victory of man<br />
And in seconds the wolves are gone</p>
<p class="cutep">
Crawl out of the shadows<br />
Show us your cowardly face</p>
<p class="cutep">
A howl in the midnight world<br />
Warns you of the coming storm<br />
Awoken has that which you shouldn't have awoken<br />
A presence to spell the doom<br />
Exordium of our conclusion<br />
Irreversible course on a path of no return</p>
<p class="cutep">
See a light so inviting at the end<br />
Adrift in the middle of a vortex of snow<br />
Only to awaken to hear them growl</p>
<p class="cutep">
Here you are on the run again<br />
Ignorant of the things you've done<br />
The lupine jaws snap at your heels<br />
Even in your dreams you feel the chills</p>
<p class="cutep">
And so it goes on and on, never at peace after dawn<br />
Forever cursed to your form<br />
The pack is calling in to mourn<br />
Abomination of steel, wolf and man, the irony of fate is grand</p>

<a id="pos6"></a><h3>The New Creations | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
The screen shows their bodies in liquid<br />
and they are eager to begin their life<br />
Drained from their cells, they gasp a first breath<br />
such a sweet smell of blood fills their nostrils</p>
<p class="cutep">
Our master, we are at your command<br />
The pleasure to kill is all yours<br />
Point your finger and just say the word<br />
Your wish is our law, if you say so we'll break the dawn</p>
<p class="cutep">
The CCTV expands the picture<br />
as men in suits all nod and approve<br />
A project coming to fruition<br />
Preparing their first and last mission</p>
<p class="cutep">
The new creations stand to form their lines<br />
War machines to project their power and lies<br />
The blackest of black, a clandestine destiny<br />
Expendable forces of subhuman value</p>
<p class="cutep">
A void of thought (They do not understand)<br />
Exquisite lack of mercy (the reason behind reason)</p>
<p class="cutep">
Assume control of the brave new world<br />
Enforced world where the people are numbers<br />
None would stand up, none would dare to<br />
A megapolis where some are more equal than others</p>
<a id="pos7"></a><h3>Lifeline | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
As they stride in the desolate plain<br />
Mechanic feet stir the forlorn grave<br />
Blackened ashes left in their wake<br />
A hollow cry as the wind for their sails</p>
<p class="cutep">
A transcendence<br />
- the promise of our augmentation<br />
Eternal life<br />
- at the cost of your humanity</p>
<p class="cutep">
Watch your hand in wonder: what did it look like?<br />
A frail strand of past is barcoded in ragged flesh<br />
As final as it seems, it has just begun</p>
<p class="cutep">
They forfeit all trace of humanity<br />
Life for them is a cybernetic existence</p>
<p class="cutep">
Past the point of no return<br />
They longingly look over their shoulder<br />
Their final life functions fade to black<br />
along with their humanity</p>
<p class="cutep">
No way to reverse the course<br />
The finality is like current through flesh<br />
We dare you to unravel the truth<br />
of past, present and beyond</p>
<p class="cutep">
Know that whatever your choice may be<br />
It is only for you to decide<br />
What we offer is a place in the book of eternity<br />
Among the new breed</p>

<a id="pos8"></a><h3>Afterworld | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
What shall it be?<br />
The world is there to shape as you please<br />
Wrought as steel imbued with flesh<br />
Drained of humanity and controlled by codes<br />
Far from ideals and enchantingly draped in woes</p>
<p class="cutep">
A new world is on the rise<br />
Concieved to regard the final demise</p>
<p class="cutep">
A stainless steel creation consuming the weak<br />
For what is weakness but a sign of their flaw</p>
<p class="cutep">
Once the transformation is set in stone<br />
No living organism you shall condone<br />
Create the world in your image<br />
Destroy it again in pure scrimmage</p>
<p class="cutep">
You seek to advance the human race<br />
A sickness you believe it to be<br />
But the profound flaw in your plan<br />
Is the total abscense of the living man</p>
<p class="cutep">
A carcass of humanity is all that's left<br />
Alone you stand with your cyborg race, all bereft</p>

<a id="pos9"></a><h3>False Salvation | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
Submit your concievement for review<br />
Balance out the results and approve<br />
They perform well up to spec<br />
Leaving you grinning without regret</p>
<p class="cutep">
A new form of life to live<br />
Well beyond the limits of man<br />
Machines of flesh and blood<br />
The will to serve is all they've got</p>
<p class="cutep">
A long gone past behind you<br />
Ravaged the kingdoms of east<br />
They could not understand it<br />
Oh such a loss was their lack of wit</p>
<p class="cutep">
Now a thunder calls your name<br />
and why would they call you insane?<br />
For does not the word too contain "sane"<br />
Clearly that shall be their bane</p>
<p class="cutep">
Stride forward in your quest to reach perfection<br />
Approve no less than the pinnacle of all creation</p>
<p class="cutep">
Golems of insanity<br />
A brigade without questions<br />
You run a foil to mankind<br />
Lead to believe in a false salvation<br />
Far they have gone and further they are yet to fall,<br />
Enhance your control of them with the torn flesh of those unworthy</p>
<p class="cutep">
Stride forward in your quest to reach perfection<br />
Approve no less than the pinnacle of all creation<br />
Mastermind of the undoing of everything considered human<br />
Nothing is nothing yet 'til you've said all that you've got to say</p>
<p class="cutep">
Now a thunder calls your name<br />
and why would they call you insane?</p>
<p class="cutep">
I am salvation!<br />
You will follow me!<br />
My command is your life!<br />
Heed me for eternity!</p>

<a id="pos10"></a><h3>Transcendence | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
After all we have gone through<br />
the time has come finalize<br />
a pact set in motion long ago<br />
Metamorphosis of humanity</p>
<p class="cutep">
A blue sliver of light cuts through the night<br />
Implants activate in all their heads<br />
Dissonant sounds take control of thoughts<br />
Preparation for their transcendence</p>
<p class="cutep">
After much thought they were in agreement<br />
It is for the ultimate phase<br />
Project Odin has so far soared high<br />
And now it shall reach an all-time low</p>
<p class="cutep">
The end is nigh, there is no denying<br />
We have advanced the human race<br />
Bio-augmentation is the call<br />
Posthumanism of us all</p>
<p class="cutep">
Hand in hand, the bionic turn mechanic<br />
and thus kiss goodbye their humanity<br />
A thought of the thin red line<br />
Is this the next step of evolution?</p>
<p class="cutep">
This is no time to reflect the past<br />
The way for us is forward<br />
Humanity as it was has gone<br />
Today - the first day of our future</p>

<a id="pos11"></a><h3>Shedding the Flesh | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="cutep">
Behold a sinister sky<br />
As it shines upon thee<br />
The transformation is soon complete<br />
Minutes pass, patience the key</p>
<p class="cutep">
Condensation consumes the view<br />
A glass cell soon to shatter<br />
Metamorphosis of the last one<br />
Signing off the darkening sun</p>
<p class="cutep">
Arise with a morbid smile<br />
The mind no longer in denial<br />
It was what you asked for!<br />
Thy wish granted for you regardless of all</p>
<p class="cutep">
The hour has finally come!<br />
Breaking away from the cocoon<br />
A new being with all new flesh<br />
The beast wishing not for a caress</p>
<p class="cutep">
Rise now, equal among few<br />
Slither past the petrified humans<br />
Biological creation of steel<br />
Gone is the weakness of flesh</p>
