<a name="1"></a><h3>Humid Skies of Darkness</h3>
<p class="indent">
Sever the clouds above<br/>
as the endless rain commences the flow<br/>
These times so highly sought<br/>
legions wiped away with this drought</p>
<p class="indent">
The gates crack wide open<br/>
none is spared - devoured the light<br/>
Blackened world coloured crimson red by<br/>
the falling curtain of mankind's end</p>
<p class="indent">
...and now at the dusk of this all<br/>
stumbling to your final fall</p>
<p class="indent">
The gates crack wide open<br/>
none is spared - devoured the light<br/>
Blackened world coloured crimson red by<br/>
the falling curtain of mankind's end</p>
<p class="indent">
Seas of blood, heavenly flood<br/>
the wound is open, come and taste<br/>
The all-makers thunder appeased<br/>
for the sleepers of styx have been released</p>
<p class="indent">
A new day's dawn ahead<br/>
another world left for dead</p>
<p class="indent">
The gates crack wide open<br/>
none is spared - devoured the light<br/>
Blackened world coloured crimson red by<br/>
the falling curtain of mankind's end</p>
<p class="indent">
Flood in the poisoned vines<br/>
Tonight the sky indelible yellow<br/>
Asphyxiation of an entire race<br/>
evolution heading at random</p>
<p class="indent">
The floodgates cannot hold them back<br/>
Relentless / powerless<br/>
Behold in awe what the future has in store<br/>
for this wrathfully broken seal</p>

<a name="2"></a><h3>Asphyxiation | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Grasp for air in this barren wasteland<br/>
of an eternity living on this godforsaken rock<br/>
For short you will be of oxygen<br/>
following the putrefaction of our future</p>
<p class="indent">
Delirious - Running short<br/>
Running low - Your last breath</p>
<p class="indent">
Grasp for air in this barren wasteland<br/>
of an eternity living on this godforsaken rock<br/>
For short you will be of oxygen<br/>
following the putrefaction of our future</p>
<p class="indent">
Asphyxiated in this carbon dioxidified<br/>
terraform of a long lost hope<br/>
Somewhere ahead looms<br/>
the destination of a mirthless race</p>
<p class="indent">
We are the breathless ones, heading for extinction<br/>
Incoherent goals, revert modes</p>

<a name="3"></a><h3>Gnawed by the Otherworldly Vex | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Run away, run away - The hordes of hell behind your back<br/>
Moon is low, moon is low - You'll soon start to lose the form<br/>
End is nigh, end is nigh - A few more steps to stay alive</p>
<p class="indent">
What is this?<br/>
You tremble down a slope so fast<br/>
A new escape, or is it really that?</p>
<p class="indent">
Deep in the pit<br/>
You feel something grow on you<br/>
'round your neck, 'round your arms<br/>
Succumbing you</p>
<p class="indent">
No, no, no, no, no, NO, NO!<br/>
You fell in a trap of the void<br/>
The shapeless figures gnawing you<br/>
The fight for freedom - desperation...</p>
<p class="indent">
The means of escape, right on your sight<br/>
You grab the void crystal tight<br/>
Harness the powers of their own<br/>
against themselves</p>
<p class="indent">
The chance, the branch, rip it off, make your move<br/>
Success is but a swift move away, waste no time</p>
<p class="indent">
The vex...<br/>
The vex...<br/>
The vex...</p>

<a name="4"></a><h3>The Variable of Irresolution | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Now I've got to get my head clear<br/>
of these unsolved feeds<br/>
These boundless thoughts are not enough<br/>
to make one sane<br/>
Oh so important numbers, endless greed<br/>
Masked variables determined to calculate your need</p>
<p class="indent">
Lost in numbers, the rattlesnakes are crawling on<br/>
Down us all they litter all new resolutions</p>
<p class="indent">
All you are is a number -<br/>
Within their forgotten books -<br/>
Know it all, for you shall -<br/>
be the source of their downfall</p>
<p class="indent">
Lead the uprising -<br/>
heading for a new rule -<br/>
Carry on the torch -<br/>
Carrions, onwards they march</p>
<p class="indent">
Lost in numbers, the rattlesnakes are crawling on<br/>
Down us all they litter all new resolutions</p>
<p class="indent">
Now it's time to make our stand<br/>
No longer shall they lay their rules</p>
<p class="indent">
Uncountable counterforce<br/>
Towards us on their course</p>
<p class="indent">
Fight on! Fight on! FIGHT ON!</p>
<p class="indent">
Rise against, behold a coming thunder<br/>
Stop the plight, it's time to put up a fight<br/>
The tide'll plough to the final core</p>
<p class="indent">
Lead the uprising -<br/>
heading for a new rule -<br/>
Carry on the torch -<br/>
Carrions, onwards they march</p>
<p class="indent">
We have reached the core<br/>
The variables they are no more</p>

<a name="5"></a><h3>Visions Macabre | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
These visions so horrid<br/>
they keep on coming<br/>
Unrelenting horrors<br/>
peaceless corpses all around</p>
<p class="indent">
Seen beyond the curtains<br/>
Unveiled in the arcane moonlight</p>
<p class="indent">
Unspeakable tragedy abound<br/>
the ancient ones set free<br/>
Tragedy among thee<br/>
evil ones of the past</p>
<p class="indent">
Have a look around, there ain't much to see<br/>
all in ruins, all<br/>
Left for dead to rot under the sun<br/>
of this best before world</p>
<p class="indent">
Infinity to process<br/>
the answer</p>
<p class="indent">
Seen beyond the curtains<br/>
Unveiled in the arcane moonlight</p>
<p class="indent">
Have a look around, there ain't much to see<br/>
all in ruins, all<br/>
Left for dead to rot under the sun<br/>
of this best before world</p>
<p class="indent">
Foreseen ages ago<br/>
Now set into motion<br/>
Infinity has passed<br/>
No answer</p>
<p class="indent">
Tragedy among thee<br/>
evil ones of the past<br/>
At the end<br/>
waiting for your answer</p>
<p class="indent">
Have a look around, there ain't much to see<br/>
all in ruins, all<br/>
Left for dead to rot under the sun<br/>
of this best before world</p>
<p class="indent">
Now we have reached the end</p>

<a name="6"></a><h3>Spiritual Entity | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3><p class="indent">
Endlessly the creatures shall prey<br/>
the weak trembling all before them</p>
<p class="indent">
Settling with arms to wage war against them<br/>
this fight shall have no mercy passed<br/>
The bloodletting shall paint the fields victor crimson<br/>
all opposition crushed by the engines of terror</p>
