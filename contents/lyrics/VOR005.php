<a id="inf1"></a><h3>Chaos Dimension</h3>
<p class="indent">Chaos</p>
<p class="indent">There it lies - a luring trap for all these years<br />
Her subtle deceit in bitter and vehement tears of joy<br />
Where we die, concealed without hope of somewhere to lie<br />
Drifting quitely across the sky - Never to reach home again</p>
<p class="indent">Summoned to the world<br />
A machine of horror - you must die<br />
No one can avoid its judgment<br />
Luring mortals like sheep</p>
<p class="indent">In your sleep, she calls you like an angel<br />
Fallen soul that I feel is somehow sick<br />
It burdens you - the crimson waters<br />
Awaken to your screams and end the nightmare</p>
<p class="indent">There's something dark - wrong in substance<br />
Did you hear their torment, now parted from earthly body shells<br />
Somewhere down through hell - come trigger your will for blood</p>
<p class="indent">Sword of mercy - a departed son of a lunatic one<br />
Bridge of will - it scorches your mechanics of self-control</p>
<p class="indent">We started the fall of impossible, pushed out of the constant time<br />
The years have gone, tonight crumbles our time and the shut door</p>
<p class="indent">Unleash the uncreators<br />
They will bring it all down<br />
With eyes sewn shut you stand<br />
Embody the purest evil</p>

<a id="inf2"></a><h3>Charcoal Earth | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Once again we tread this path<br />
Charred and destroyed, it lies ahead<br />
Cause and effect - they are the same<br />
As for the reason, it matters not</p>
<p class="indent">The ashes born by earth<br />
scornful pride and gathering dust<br />
Such was the way of this crop<br />
Now returning to the womb of time</p>
<p class="indent">Their soul devoid of regret<br />
Finger, the trigger, and the time to die<br />
Through so, their faces sly<br />
The era of humans dictated by rope</p>
<p class="indent">Graves are full<br />
Of the product devised by nothing but an animal<br />
Once a pinnacle of advanced time<br />
Their season of luck eaten</p>
<p class="indent">Disease - man-made suppression of the people<br />
Reason - whenever someone had hell to see<br />
New lord of the falling few, products insane<br />
If they hold out, the government will take their life<br />
A rotten game in the fields of world<br />
Wrong: dead. No name.</p>
<p class="indent">Chemicals corrode the earth<br />
Now hope is gone, just run for the bunker</p>
<p class="indent">In the ages to come<br />
forgotten like the sun<br />
Floating in nothingness<br />
Consumed by time</p>
<p class="indent">No embers, no sound<br />
A defaced existence<br />
In a cold empty space<br />
Short is the supply for regretfulness</p>

<a id="inf3"></a><h3>Pyre of Souls | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">The souls are gathering at the edge of the zone<br />
Unwilling to enter, for they know of the tales<br />
Visitors from the great untold and their motivation unknown<br />
Whether they still remain is up for debate</p>
<p class="indent">Shaken soldiers is what I saw there<br />
She'll show them bodies turning inside out<br />
Rotting the brains inside<br />
The slaughter foreseen here for multiple times</p>
<p class="indent">Bring the silent option<br />
tonight's mission: Full-Empties for gold<br />
For some, they are worth a life<br />
Summon courage and enter the fray now, to die</p>
<p class="indent">And this is why I told them to abandon hope<br />
You must keep looking for the unseen reality<br />
Don't think that you'll survive this place another time<br />
You may survive but for sure your life is over the next time</p>
<p class="indent">Winds aren't blowing at all<br />
The sun is fully blocked away<br />
Here their soil begins<br />
The reek, the fire, and a hasty death</p>
<p class="indent">Last song for those out of time<br />
Yet their final dance: without flesh on bones<br />
Down in the roadside ditch<br />
A fog with a visceral death awaits</p>
<p class="indent">Paranormal energy<br />
an anomaly that waits to tear you apart<br />
Shreds a complete body<br />
to hundred pieces in the blink of an eye<br />
Don't ever think of, or plan an escape<br />
They will cut you down before your first step</p>
<p class="indent">Time shall tell when they return<br />
Due to their visitation, all science as we know it has been erased</p>
<p class="indent">These are grave implications<br />
Did they seek to debase our world?<br />
Reject our flawed physics<br />
Into battle with knowledge we shoot headfirst</p>

<a id="inf4"></a><h3>Wire Synapse | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Connect your body<br />
A machine-made human analogue<br />
Receive and process<br />
Vital rules define your existence</p>
<p class="indent">Validate the outcome<br />
A clear result must be obtained<br />
Generate the outline<br />
Execution of utmost priority</p>
<p class="indent">Post-op scans confirm the mission<br />
Carried out with absolute precision<br />
Deviations are not expected<br />
For such is not even possible</p>
<p class="indent">Once the deed is completed<br />
A recall to your station is executed<br />
No thought runs through your mind<br />
Under control and part of the hive</p>
<p class="indent">Now!</p>
<p class="indent">Ohjelmoitu mieli ilman oman ajatuksen häivää<br />
Ei pyydä aivot tekemään muuta kuin käskettyä<br />
Autuaan tietämätön, ei kerro silmät maailman menosta<br />
Tähän koneeseen olet joutunut ja tulet olemaan osa sitä</p>
<p class="textIndent">(TRANSLATION:<br />
<i>A programmed mind without a trace of own thoughts<br />
The brain asking for nothing more than being commanded<br />
Blissfully unaware, the eyes see nothing what happens<br />
You have been cast into this machine, and you shall be a part of it)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Now I am, as one with the machine<br />
Wired into the system</p>
