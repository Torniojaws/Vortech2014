<a id="dev1"></a><h3>The Black Rite</h3>
<p class="indent">A complex built for life's endurance<br />
Devised to save what is left to save in this crumbling world<br />
Safeguarding your unspeakable deeds<br />
Merely to forward your sickening needs<br />
With your steady hand of doom<br />
Uncreation of this boon</p>
<p class="indent">Hands devoid of willing control<br />
Violence in the mind is taking a hold<br />
Unable to cease the action<br />
Disturbing revelations beyond infractions</p>
<p class="indent">Of the darkness, comes our hope<br />
For him it means an unbroken rope<br />
Unheeded goes the final warning<br />
Dark science to be his undoing</p>
<p class="indent">A fateful night<br />
Endeavour to comprehend the rite<br />
Vile changes<br />
toward the unknown we go</p>
<p class="indent">Mischief in the highest levels<br />
A fire ablaze in their eyes<br />
Hatred is their fuel<br />
for this lifelong corruption</p>
<p class="indent">The dawn is rising<br />
Virulent, a dark shining<br />
Science and the end of days<br />
Bring about a crooked haze</p>
<p class="indent">Faint is the level of knowledge<br />
Aspire to reach a volatile hold<br />
Rising of the resistance<br />
A call misinformed and people misled</p>
<p class="indent">And now the light of day<br />
Reaches down through the rain<br />
In so, it paves the way<br />
A red carpet for an enduring pain</p>
<p class="indent">And now the blight of gray<br />
Reaches you through the pain<br />
In so, it paves the way<br />
A blackened rite for a decaying day</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;In darkness we floated out of control&quot;<br />
A virus now coursing in their veins<br />
They praise the creator for making it happen<br />
And he smiles, laughing at their obliviousness</p>

<a id="dev2"></a><h3>Neurovirus | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">They carry it inside them<br />
Sleeper cell of a viral kind<br />
The spread pattern is out of hand<br />
Waning chances of aversion</p>
<p class="indent">All control is lost by noon<br />
Yet they still do not know<br />
Covert is the contagion<br />
Irreversible the infliction</p>
<p class="indent">
In the way of science, you were so sure<br />
That for this creation, you made no cure<br />
A swansong for the epitaph<br />
Carved to stone, as you laugh</p>
<p class="indent">
Neural by its nature<br />
Chemical synapses transmit the flaw<br />
Propagate the behavior war<br />
Enslaved to the virus we are</p>
<p class="indent">
No vaccine to prevent it all<br />
As a devised doom ensnares the world<br />
Perfection with a poison hold<br />
and by your actions we shall fold</p>
<p class="indent">
For the deed you commited<br />
A fitting reward is in store<br />
As the day of days goes on by<br />
You reach the eclipse of your own time</p>

<a id="dev3"></a><h3>Shattered Cities | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">These volatile shells of life<br />
Suspect is the level of hope<br />
None of it beyond their eyes<br />
As the surviving ones all cower in fear</p>
<p class="indent">Chaos sweeps the remaining world<br />
Shattered cities left in the wake<br />
Authority is no longer there<br />
The final shield clatters in pieces</p>
<p class="indent">
Tortured souls gaining no control<br />
Mechanical bodies acting commandless<br />
Eyes of terror is all they see<br />
When they catch a glimpse in the mirror</p>
<p class="indent">
Aware with screams within<br />
Yet no sound is self-produced<br />
Fragile agony is what you feel<br />
As on the altar of death we kneel</p>
<p class="indent">
Broken glass is your legacy<br />
a matress of pain for his heresy<br />
All that remains:<br />
Shattered cities, barren plains</p>
<p class="indent">Trodden by the wind in the streets<br />
Howling its inhuman note<br />
Underscoring the current state -<br />
Gradual dehumanization</p>

<a id="dev4"></a><h3>Demon In the Circuitry | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Synthetic – their nature<br />
Indifference – their code<br />
A welcome the most cold in kind<br />
Calculated – their future<br />
Unexpendable – their role<br />
Unleash the demon in the circuitry</p>
<p class="indent">
A boon in these troubled times<br />
When humans suffer the machine<br />
Powerless upon the sands<br />
We're adrift in desolation</p>
<p class="indent">
Desert haven in everyone's sights<br />
Not a soul considers the irony<br />
The struggle to survive is caused by ourselves<br />
True reasons - trivial and set behind</p>
<p class="indent">
Immune to physical harm<br />
Fortified in mechanic rule</p>
<p class="indent">
It was once said: sticks and stones<br />
And thus it's proven - a war would start<br />
Humankind versus man<br />
Cast the first rock to save yourself</p>
<p class="indent">
Grand is the final engagement<br />
As the remnant ebb in numbers<br />
Driven out of the metropolis<br />
Cast down from the ruler's throne</p>
<p class="indent">Yet the genious part is:<br />
The virus affects us all</p>
<p class="indent">
A threefold danger<br />
Machine, man &amp; man<br />
Should the virus have a face<br />
For sure it would sport a grin<br />
And in so, ignite the war</p>

<a id="dev5"></a><h3>Frozen Machine | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Brooding and contemplating<br />
Powerless stands the military<br />
A demon to kill, but control to instill<br />
To fight against this enemy</p>
<p class="indent">
A machine frozen makes the virus die<br />
But in so, all those kept alive<br />
By the machines of salvation<br />
They become their damnation</p>
<p class="indent">
Regression of the thinking mind<br />
Collective erosion of the will<br />
Primal instinct surpasses all your sense<br />
Do what you're told, not what you feel</p>
<p class="indent">Deep is the state of lockdown<br />
Society to be erased<br />
A new beginning for those from past<br />
Starts now by destroying the future</p>
<p class="indent">
Inherent is the need to improve<br />
Unorthodox the method to do so<br />
To condemn those who are not strong<br />
Or to confirm a certain doom</p>
<p class="indent">
Consequences....<br />
There will be a dissent to arise<br />
Setting back the humankind<br />
Prevention of all progress</p>

<a id="dev6"></a><h3>Lost | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Dreams of control in the highest levels<br />
Crashing down with a tumbling fall<br />
Forfeit is the remaining world<br />
Who shall remain in the end?</p>
<p class="indent">
Divided nations fighting for supremacy<br />
Merciless are the acts commited<br />
One final conflict to settle the score<br />
(Just another step for many more)</p>
<p class="indent">
Admitted imbecility<br />
drastic measures that you call pre-emptive<br />
A hollow tone is uttered</p>
<p class="indent">The voice of self-service<br />
Mass decision to suppress the invih3idual<br />
An institution lost in corruption, ineffective machinery of a bygone world</p>
<p class="indent">
Vanishing light of civilization<br />
Waning in the dusk of a passing era<br />
Factions forming, a rebirth in silence<br />
Shroudclad gathering of the lost ones</p>
<p class="indent">
A brotherhood with a certain goal<br />
Not pursuing the good of us all<br />
Yet with the greatest chance they live<br />
As others perish in bitter pain</p>
<p class="indent">
Oppression called – for the greater good<br />
Such thoughts you entertain, to yourself it serves an exhorting flame<br />
Suffering the people – you know it be in vain<br />
They cannot know of the higher purpose in this agony</p>

<a id="dev7"></a><h3>Unveiling the Future | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">The future unveils behind a drape, so dark<br />
Inhospitable became the world<br />
A virus running unchecked at large<br />
Not a breath is heard out there</p>
<p class="indent">
Control – this was their dream<br />
fleeting was the moment<br />
It crumbled in their hands<br />
like sand they sought to hold</p>
<p class="indent">
Fruitless they know it to be<br />
Foolish hope, stupidity, or ignorance?<br />
In any case, they charge at a brickwall<br />
This reality is no feature film</p>
<p class="indent">
Factions drawing their last breath<br />
Bleeding their bretheren at arms<br />
Marvel at the final insult<br />
to humanity and all their kind</p>
<p class="indent">Disbelieving laughter of the last one<br />
A final whimper of their extinction<br />
Driven to extreme measures<br />
Unable to cope with this new life</p>
<p class="indent">
This punctuation to an era<br />
A chapter ends, and the page is turned<br />
Will it be a better world awaiting?<br />
All that's sure, we won't see it</p>

<a id="dev8"></a><h3>The Apocalypse | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Let it serve as a painful reminder of what could be<br />
A surge through you with every single breath<br />
Frantically seeking for answers</p>
<p class="indent">
Mysteries within longing for the spotlight<br />
Desperate to be the one they know<br />
Not a day passes without a reminder<br />
That it is no noble cause you express</p>
<p class="indent">
From one to another – a cycle completes<br />
Leaving a wake of unendurable pain<br />
Radiating its message – a message of depletion<br />
Affecting us all with unpredictable disdain</p>
<p class="indent">
This ailment leaving you all but<br />
Dead in your trembling tracks</p>
<p class="indent">
Fruitless it will prove to be<br />
To be the doom of you</p>
<p class="indent">
An aftermath to rival the past<br />
Gone but not devoid of life</p>
<p class="indent">
Only one way to rid this disease<br />
Complete and pure in its form<br />
With surgical precision it all comes to end<br />
It serves a necessary amend</p>
<p class="indent">
An aftermath to rival the past<br />
Gone but not devoid of life<br />
One final breath of vile wrath<br />
As it withers with the apocalypse</p>

<a id="dev9"></a><h3>Grains of Reality | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
