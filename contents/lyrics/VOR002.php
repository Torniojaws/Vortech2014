<a id="was1"></a><h3>The Core</h3>
<p class="indent">
Among the shadows of darkened minds<br />
Schemes are brewing, hidden from watchful eyes<br />
Plans of war, unleashing of hell<br />
Against whom, one cannot tell</p>
<p class="indent">
Reach down to the core<br />
Discover a corporate whore<br />
Flayers of decency<br />
Blindfolded courtesy</p>
<p class="indent">
War by instigation<br />
Chaotic retribution<br />
Reapers of life<br />
seeders of strife</p>
<p class="indent">
Among the shadows of darkened minds<br />
Schemes are brewing, hidden from watchful eyes<br />
Plans of war, unleashing of hell<br />
Against whom, one cannot tell</p>
<p class="indent">
We stand at the threshold<br />
A storm is coming<br />
Time will tell<br />
Who will live through this hell</p>
<p class="indent">
Among the shadows of darkened minds<br />
Schemes are brewing, hidden from watchful eyes<br />
Plans of war, unleashing of hell<br />
Against whom, one cannot tell</p>

<a id="was2"></a><h3>Evolutionary Project | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
The system has failed<br />
Prominent hostility<br />
Governed by fear<br />
7.62 mm quarrel</p>
<p class="indent">
The world in flames<br />
Political bigot games<br />
Machines of society<br />
Grinding to a halt</p>
<p class="indent">
Darkness surrounds us<br />
Abandoned in the shadows of war<br />
Piercing cold to puncture the deal of doom</p>
<p class="indent">
Evolutionary project<br />
Dissidents are silently repressed<br />
Shadowclad enforcers<br />
Denied of all remorses</p>
<p class="indent">
Martial law provides all they need<br />
their leaders' call they will heed<br />
Confined in concrete cells<br />
publicizing your private hells</p>
<p class="indent">
Debased world order<br />
Shedding blood for the human gods<br />
Crooked fate, anonymous hate<br />
A system designed to lacerate</p>
<p class="indent">
War never changes<br />
The embers smoulder strong with passionate zeal<br />
No escape as the shelling rages<br />
Your mind you cannot feel</p>

<a id="was3"></a><h3>Their Contract | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
The morning sun reflecting on their eyes<br />
What they do is all a lie<br />
A contract bound in flesh and signed with blood<br />
In our name you will kill - or be shot</p>
<p class="indent">
Shaved and trained to look all the same<br />
Just so that there'll be none to take the blame<br />
Sanguine sunrise - the day we must die<br />
No one shall leave these fields alive</p>
<p class="indent">
A blade of hatred, bisecting all who oppose<br />
Suppressing all the critics - with silence, not by choice<br />
the days of democracy have come to an end<br />
Bitter rivalry making us all</p>
<p class="indent">
Quench the gun, so violently - they want you to kill<br />
In your ditch, you gather the rage - well done, pull the trigger<br />
Cut down the enemy - they'll do the same to you<br />
Fire away with no regret - you are entitled to</p>

<a id="was4"></a><h3>Instigate Hostile Reaction | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
The flickering screen shows all the signs<br />
&quot;There is no war&quot; - the government denies<br />
Denial and games - the P.R. slaves<br />
That's how the world decays</p>
<p class="indent">
Fa&ccedil;ades appease the simple minds<br />
Shadows cast down by shutting blinds<br />
Look over your shoulder... saw that?<br />
Yes, now you know.</p>
<p class="indent">
Statements are made to follow<br />
"You shall obey!" they bellow<br />
Uttering their complete nonsense<br />
Lies are told with full conscience</p>
<p class="indent">
What the public doesn't know<br />
The seeds of ignorance for us to sow<br />
Pathway to excellence:<br />
Absence of audience</p>
<p class="indent">
We are surveyed<br />
In their eyes<br />
Hidden in disguise</p>
<p class="indent">
Beholding our lives<br />
Patiently awaiting<br />
For the excuse</p>
<p class="indent">
The skies are burning with a deep red glow<br />
You are a witness to a world that has come to explode<br />
Fatal demonstrations of a world-wide supremacy<br />
Flawed reasons for grievancy</p>

<a id="was5"></a><h3>Impulse | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Chaos is spreading all throughout the world<br />
The horizon is flashing with nuclear discord<br />
The days of apologies are way past, beyond all thought<br />
Unthinkably furious retaliation, global damage is what they sought</p>
<p class="indent">
Agonizing death as your skin falls off<br />
You can thank yourselves for all you got<br />
Worldwide crematorium<br />
In a chapel built of fire</p>
<p class="indent">
A blinding wave of fire<br />
Trailed by our death's desire<br />
The screams of a thousand burning souls<br />
As their flesh melts right off their bones</p>
<p class="indent">
A silent moment right before the blast<br />
It will be a long time before the last</p>
<p class="indent">
A man-made funeral pyre<br />
I believe we can breathe the fire</p>

<a id="was6"></a><h3>Perdition | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Mushrooms of sickening slaughter<br />
their makers are the earth's own blighters<br />
Burning through all man-made shelters<br />
bloody pulps of men and women shattered</p>
<p class="indent">
More blasts are going on in the distance<br />
Fire away to wipe out the resistance<br />
Blinding waves of light in the distance<br />
Feel the need to call for assistance</p>
<p class="indent">
See the sky for a startling sighting<br />
Grim and eerie turn of the fighting<br />
Hundred thousand missiles and spearheads<br />
Their sight is an unnerving appearance</p>
<p class="indent">
Make your way to the nearest bunker<br />
Run away from the nuclear barking<br />
In a few seconds you will be dead<br />
'cause the bombs are all at your tread</p>
<p class="indent">
The wheel of conclusion<br />
Leveling the sands of life<br />
Grains of what used to be<br />
Split by the cycle of doom</p>
<p class="indent">
Decay</p>
<p class="indent">
The fate of humanity is to burn in the flame of truth<br />
Reaching higher, engulfing our tears<br />
stripping away their masks<br />
The soothing hand of Death is well within our doomed grasp</p>

<a id="was7"></a><h3>The Silence | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Instrumental</p>

<a id="was8"></a><h3>Winds of Contamination | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Take a look at the world around you<br />
All the things done, how it was run<br />
Fear not for the age of decay<br />
You won't live that long anyway</p>
<p class="indent">
Outside in the wastes<br />
A new world now awaits<br />
Gear up for you know it to be true<br />
They are out there just to get you</p>
<p class="indent">
The sirens are wailing their warning<br />
Striving to reach your attention<br />
But you ignore them and open the gate<br />
To fix your deed is far too late</p>
<p class="indent">
The winds of contamination strike you in the face<br />
A duet of pestilence and filth<br />
Watch the sky in awestruck despair<br />
The venom coursing right through your veins</p>
<p class="indent">
Radiation piercing your body<br />
Agony as you wade in the dust<br />
Feel it burn inside your throat<br />
The end is near you can hear it coming</p>

<a id="was9"></a><h3>Radiant Storm | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Behold the midnight sky pulsate with fury<br />
Devastation brought down with rain<br />
Godless gloom surfacing, striking you down<br />
The sky is blazing with thunder and hate</p>
<p class="indent">
Uncontrollable force, crowning our world<br />
A kingdom of ashes, shattered by a gale<br />
Like a mirror reflecting the future<br />
With the coldness of nails through your eyes</p>
<p class="indent">
There is nothing left to be said<br />
All is said and done, prepare yourselves<br />
Unmarked graves, knee-deep in radiation</p>
<p class="indent">
Devilish devices cutting through mankind<br />
Evolutionary target: absolute eradication<br />
Skinless you rot under the sun<br />
and soon they will all share the fun</p>
