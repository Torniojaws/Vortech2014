<a id="dee1"></a><h3>The Awakening</h3>
<p class="indent">
Deep down, legions under the sea<br />
ancient beings dormant lie and wait for release<br />
For the waters of the oceans lock them down<br />
the aeons passed have been abound</p>
<p class="indent">
The slimy vaults creak wide open<br />
as the generator comes to life<br />
Silent generators succumb the tide<br />
and so shall They too be fully alive</p>
<p class="indent">
Biomechanic creatures form their ranks<br />
Platinum blades cycle and spin by flanks<br />
Masterpiece of the Great Old Ones<br />
Violent sadistic machine devoid of guns</p>
<p class="indent">
But now beneath the hunter's moon<br />
their unleashing all but soon<br />
Bright blue lighting fire up in the room<br />
their legions are ready to bring your doom</p>
<p class="indent">
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn<br />
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn<br />
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn<br />
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn</p>

<a id="dee2"></a><h3>Biodroid Legions | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Heed the signal from beyond our time<br />
A grating screech echoes throughout the structure<br />
Once that was, now left behind<br />
They shall convey the final rupture</p>
<p class="indent">
We - the bionic response<br />
The Great Old Ones' end of line<br />
Feel - our wrath upon thee<br />
Creations set free from millennial confine</p>
<p class="indent">
Convergence with reality, is this the<br />
final hour of our ancient slumber<br />
The beast they shouldn't have forgotten<br />
is soon unleashed upon the frail and weak</p>
<p class="indent">
Do they realize the gravity of the state<br />
Therein lies the key to the ancient conflict<br />
No one to answer their intertwined malice and hate<br />
They are now masterless at the perils of a binary instinct</p>

<a id="dee3"></a><h3>The Undying Storm | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Unknowing people watching the sea<br />
Beneath the horror lurks<br />
just underneath the restless surface<br />
wide awake</p>
<p class="indent">
Falter not when the time is upon thee<br />
For steady you must be to tell the tale<br />
of a sordid encounter - the beings of olden</p>
<p class="indent">
The restless surface<br />
A wide awake nightmare<br />
Goosebumped flesh<br />
Trembling before them</p>
<p class="indent">
What is that you see?<br />
Can it even be so real?<br />
For hideous is their skin<br />
which is no skin at all</p>
<p class="indent">
They bear so remarkable resemblance<br />
In their eyes you see yourself<br />
But the malformation disheartens you</p>
<p class="indent">
Even those strong of mind<br />
if not even especially them<br />
tread the thinnest straw of losing their mind</p>
<p class="indent">
The forming storm<br />
Paints a scene set for a crimson dawn<br />
Shellshock the world<br />
The grip of order unfurled</p>
<p class="indent">
Biomechanical slaughter<br />
Meticulous demons from the water<br />
The perfect endoform<br />
Brought along the undying storm</p>
<p class="indent">
The twilight of humanity<br />
a twist of irony befalls<br />
The saviours are bringers of doom</p>
<p class="indent">
Out in the driving rain<br />
The Ones created for us to save<br />
- They shall lead us to our grave</p>
<p class="indent">
The change is here<br />
There is nothing to stop them at all<br />
The spawn of Cthulhu<br />
Will forever more be our bane</p>
<p class="indent">
Biomechanical slaughter<br />
Meticulous demons from the water<br />
The perfect endoform<br />
Brought along the undying storm</p>

<a id="dee4"></a><h3>Shadow Shapes | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
The shadows entice in vision<br />
A form clad in derision<br />
They slither through fields of gore<br />
And they will come back for more</p>
<p class="indent">
To describe their body<br />
One would need to be insane<br />
Hideous - a beast by design</p>
<p class="indent">
The creatures gather pace<br />
You shall be erased<br />
Your final memory <br />
buried under the goo</p>
<p class="indent">
Yog-Shoggoth - heed his call<br />
Forfeit your life - consumed in whole</p>
<p class="indent">
The waves are calling, for<br />
a message awaits with intention<br />
Hear the words of the imprisoned son<br />
The call of cthulhu - the great old one</p>
<p class="indent">
Dark down the deeps<br />
They linger, await for the call<br />
Invasion of the shadowed shapes<br />
Their bodies ethereal and devoid of hopes</p>
<p class="indent">
Forgotten and buried so far in<br />
lost memories far under the sea<br />
Your time has come my depraved ones<br />
Let the curse once again lay all to waste</p>

<a id="dee5"></a><h3>Retribution | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Standing there, among the ruins<br />
You wander through the blood and gears<br />
The evident signs of a tragedy<br />
There was none they could have done</p>
<p class="indent">
The spawn of evil<br />
an ageless cult<br />
Those things made out of steel and bionic mass</p>
<p class="indent">
In pursuit through the woods and blackened substance<br />
Whatever they may be they for sure are no sound creations</p>
<p class="indent">
Pull out your guns, for you feel them oh so near<br />
Just in time to avoid its charge and sheer</p>
<p class="indent">
Chaotic beings of sickening build<br />
they must be to have done all this<br />
As the sun falls below horizon<br />
Thus begins your retribution</p>
<p class="indent">
Your rifle is clacking again and again<br />
Oceanic entities screech and squall<br />
Echoes against the cliff alert them all<br />
For it is time for you to fall, FALL!</p>
<p class="indent">
The creatures divert their attention<br />
Chitonic blades unfold and swing<br />
Splattering blood all over the place<br />
As they indulge their appetite for chase</p>
<p class="indent">
Though you know it to be your last dawn<br />
You press on to fight them all<br />
Lock and load all your guns<br />
Tonight They shall fall by tons</p>
<p class="indent">
Chaotic beings of sickening build<br />
they must be to have done all this<br />
As the sun falls below horizon<br />
Thus begins your retribution</p>
<p class="indent">
Fall to your knees to discover the scene<br />
Lamentations of all those who died<br />
The voices of the dead twist your mind<br />
There shall be no sleep tonight</p>

<a id="dee6"></a><h3>Bewildered | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
What is it that you are hunting for?<br />
Could it be that it was you all along?<br />
Those monstrosities were all a creation of your distorted mind<br />
Perversions of your own frail sanity and grime</p>
<p class="indent">
Look down to your hands<br />
Those spills are a tell-tale sign<br />
In your mind the vile nausea<br />
Gallops to overrun your dawn</p>
<p class="indent">
Cthulhu, what have you done to me?<br />
I did not ask for any of this</p>
<p class="indent">
Cthulhu, what have you done to me?<br />
I did not ask for any of this<br />
For this state there is only one known cure<br />
And with fear and stutter you step to the edge</p>
<p class="indent">
What was it that you were hunting for?<br />
Could it be that it was you all along?<br />
Those monstrosities were all a creation of your distorted mind<br />
Perversions of your own frail sanity and grime</p>
<p class="indent">
It is time for you to think it through<br />
Never questioned any of it that you all but knew<br />
Yourself it was that oh so devoutly heeded his call<br />
Now at the time of revelation you lunge deep beneath</p>

<a id="dee7"></a><h3>Deep Beneath | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Instrumental</p>

<a id="dee8"></a><h3>Subjugation | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
There isn't a single soul around here, deep under<br />
All you see is vast plains of sunken worlds so long gone<br />
Then it hits you that you still haven't drowned, on the contrary<br />
Breathing here so arbitrary for you know it to be in vain</p>
<p class="indent">
The work of darkened age, devicing you through<br />
Mystic truths fill out your blanks as if you already knew<br />
But deep down you know it to be not just but exactly so<br />
You have been here before all those ages ago</p>
<p class="indent">
The rusty thoughts spring out to your eyes<br />
For your life so far has been all lies</p>
<p class="indent">
Injection to your mind<br />
Adduction to the blind<br />
Refined process of subjugation</p>
<p class="indent">
There is one brooding darkness to confront<br />
Spawn of Cthulhu to suffer the blunt</p>
<p class="indent">
&quot;Show yourself, oh Great Old One!&quot;<br />
&quot;I am here to eternally-<br />
-punish you for what you have done!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh the pain giving has just begun&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">
&quot;Show yourself, oh Great Old One!&quot;<br />
&quot;I am here to eternally-<br />
-punish them for what they have done!&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">
And thus was his mind all undone.</p>

<a id="dee9"></a><h3>Exile Within | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
Restless phase so common these days, find yourself lost in a haze<br />
How can this be, what is it that you feed?<br />
Those memories for sure cannot be wrong, what you feel is not all that's been going on<br />
Conjure up your two selfs - see which one does not belong</p>
<p class="indent">
Now the world is shifting around you<br />
Before your eyes it turns untrue<br />
Once again you discover it false<br />
Yet you still brace all its faults</p>
<p class="indent">
Life in a world out of phase<br />
steers you so far in daze<br />
What anymore is real and not beyond<br />
or has it all been moving on?</p>
<p class="indent">
Arcane, forgotten past<br />
Knowledge of uttermost importance turned aghast<br />
Face the reaper of reality<br />
The drainer of human vitality</p>
<p class="indent">
The desert offers you no more hope than the other world currently<br />
in ruins - drowned in smoke but there is something so very, very wrong<br />
about the way those sands keep shifting under the very eyes of yourself<br />
The way it feels is like this plane would not even be but in your very mind</p>

<a id="dee10"></a><h3>So They Rise | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">
So many things have come to pass<br />
and what I have witnessed has left me a ruin<br />
There are no words to describe what I saw<br />
all I can recount is this log you read</p>
<p class="indent">
As I write these words from beyond<br />
Their invasion has already begun<br />
There is nothing anyone can do<br />
as the first few were just their skew</p>
<p class="indent">
A fatal force marches on and on<br />
Deep beneath their gathering is done<br />
At the first break of dawn they rise<br />
The Old Ones did so master a guise</p>
<p class="indent">
But there it is, I can see their outlines take shape<br />
Look there down at the oceanside<br />
No use to gasp for air or speculate whence they came<br />
The time has come to pass when all life is extinguished</p>
