<a id="imp1"></a><h3>Corroded</h3>
<p class="indent">It eats your soul<br />
It consumes the will<br />
It fades the shine<br />
A damage so permanent</p>
<p class="indent">All your strength going down the drain<br />
Detrimental transition gone astray<br />
Crippled beyond any physical limit<br />
And the process took a mere minute</p>
<p class="indent">Far - and few between<br />
A world of honor, no longer the owner<br />
Transformed is the world, forever,<br />
They thought of themselves oh so clever</p>
<p class="indent">Well it fell through their hands<br />
Leaving a scorchmark of corroded lands<br />
Free for them to wander and marvel<br />
At their magnificent achievement</p>
<p class="indent">Chemical landscape with a price tag<br />
Business is business, and money comes with no flag<br />
Be glad to be out of harms way<br />
And take your part in the modern day</p>

<a id="imp2"></a><h3>The Observers | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Cruising through these barren wastes<br />
Searching for sanctuary<br />
Relentlessly hunted by them<br />
Human tissue, but steel inside</p>
<p class="indent">Deserted are these lands<br />
Weeks on end, no signs of life<br />
Up in the sky you still see them<br />
Ever watchful, scanning us all</p>
<p class="indent">Out in the cold, dark world<br />
Circumstantially absent life<br />
Human slaves long since converted<br />
Powered by an external flame</p>
<p class="indent">Streams of light, a nightly event<br />
No longer hiding as the need has passed<br />
Seeking out all able bodies<br />
Cybernetic creations in organic shells</p>
<p class="indent">Built to last, and to serve<br />
Central spire with a kill control<br />
Tying up all lose ends<br />
A counter for the arrival</p>
<p class="indent">A crackling signal in your earpiece<br />
The General comments on the choice<br />
&quot;Save the last bullet for yourselves!&quot;<br />
This chilling statement, his final words</p>
<p class="indent">Now their eyes are set on you!<br />
A rush of machinery heading this way<br />
You better run, you better hide<br />
Or drown in the mechanical tide</p>

<a id="imp3"></a><h3>Devour the Being | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Far behind us<br />
the earth is burning<br />
Disintegrating<br />
in our eyes</p>
<p class="indent">This final journey<br />
An escape through the stars<br />
Planets all around us<br />
cease to exist</p>
<p class="indent">The black hole is the key<br />
An endless space of nothingness<br />
Devouring our very being<br />
Journey into the unknown</p>
<p class="indent">We know there is nothing<br />
Take your last glimpse and try to forget<br />
When the timeless beings run out of time<br />
Back to square one, reversal of time</p>
<p class="indent">A universal collapse - Absolute implosion<br />
Faces twisting, bodies in disarray<br />
The painful redirection of all things that be<br />
Ultimate cataclysm, proportions reduced to nothing<br />

<a id="imp4"></a><h3>Uncreation | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemen, gather 'round the table&quot;<br />
A smile and a gesture follows<br />
Suspecting ulterior motives<br />
The voice inside calls for strength</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;We are here to address the issue&quot;<br />
Barely hidden fear<br />
The eyes, deceptive as they are,<br />
A veil of truth to hide deceit<br />
	&quot;Feel free to peruse the details&quot;<br />
A paper lies prepared<br />
Curiously ancient looking<br />
	&quot;Just sign on the bottom line...&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">	&quot;The solution stands in writing&quot;<br />
Damned if there isn't something strange<br />
Carried out like an empty shell<br />
Hollow body with a crooked taint</p>
<p class="indent">The downward stumble<br />
Crashing through the wall<br />
Embraced by the darkness outside<br />
Money in hand, you fall</p>
<p class="indent">A relieving breeze of air<br />
To get the stench out of your lungs<br />
On your way down, behold the nightmare<br />
The world destroyed by the behest of your hand</p>
<p class="indent">	&quot;And thus it is written&quot;<br />
The fatal contract binding<br />
Selling the world<br />
Was a deed coated in gold<br />
	&quot;Our meeting has reached the end&quot;<br />
The slither echoes in your mind<br />
To this day, it drives you insane<br />
A cosmic eye looking back at you</p>
