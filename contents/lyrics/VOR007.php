<a id="occ1"></a><h3>Forgotten World</h3>
<p class="indent">Everything has changed<br />
A barren world, abandoned<br />
Distant in our memory<br />
Now floating right in front of us</p>
<p class="indent">Passing by these skeleton cities<br />
We are reminded once again<br />
Since time immemorial<br />
have the machines claimed deed to all these lands</p>
<p class="indent">"Systematic" is how the records describe it<br />
A world so utterly ravaged, and so thoroughly damaged<br />
Unknown lords, destruction served as the main course<br />
Greedly they devoured away the yesterworld</p>
<p class="indent">A thousand years<br />
Without signs of life<br />
Their will<br />
has been maintained<br />
Corrupt<br />
to the core<br />
Still they did not see<br />
for ignorance is bliss</p>
<p class="indent">Warfare was unneeded<br />
Deprived and decimated<br />
Sturdy were the walls built<br />
Kept in disease and machines</p>

<a id="occ2"></a><h3>Mechanicide | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Ever-watchful they stand there<br />
Impervious to the freezing rain<br />
Protective gargoyles<br />
Keepers of enforced silence</p>
<p class="indent">Scanners penetrate the skin<br />
Reaching deep to uncover the soul<br />
Fervent scavengers<br />
Seekers of unspoken betrayal</p>
<p class="indent">Sudden is the moment<br />
Wings expand, the hunt is on!<br />
Steel-blue laser eyes<br />
Machines made to deliver demise</p>
<p class="indent">Tonight they serve us death<br />
Mechanicide to end the lies<br />
Weakened flesh now bends to will<br />
In wrath they are deviced</p>
<p class="indent">Darkened skies now hammer the streets<br />
Piercing right down to the core<br />
Forceful deliverance<br />
Of the human flaw</p>

<a id="occ3"></a><h3>The Origin | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">If you seek the answer you must bear the truth<br />
Witness the sickness and be drained of youth<br />
Supply for the false hope is set to decay<br />
And point of return has drifted lightyears away<br />
Driven by conclusions predetermined<br />
Monumental foolishness will highlight your doom</p>
<p class="indent">Discover the origin, your god isn't there<br />
But the beast inside you soon whips the air<br />
Discover the origin, your god isn't there<br />
Faith takes swift turn into despair</p>
<p class="indent">All that glitters is gold?</p>
<p class="indent">Destination in the reach but mystery yet unresolved<br />
What remains to be seen is not quite what you believe<br />
The one in millenial slumber, the creator you presume<br />
You have awaken destoyer, bringer of doom</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed there's creation to eclipse any evil you fear<br />
With sole purpose of eradication, crafted into perfection<br />
Reasons become evident, secluded, desolate, forsaken<br />
From the edge of universe they'll track down your path</p>
<p class="indent">Discover the origin, your god isn't there<br />
But the beast inside you soon whips the air<br />
Discover the origin, your god isn't there<br />
Faith takes swift turn into despair<br />
Ravage of blissfull ignorance<br />
Causality with a taste of irony<br />
You gave your life in servitude of lie<br />
Now truth will take eye for an eye</p>

<a id="occ4"></a><h3>Controlled | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">We are at war!<br />
A war against all life on earth<br />
The hive mind in control<br />
Binary commands for the system</p>
<p class="indent">Displacements on the way<br />
The way ending in our demise<br />
A demise for the unseen ones<br />
The eremitic entity of this earth</p>
<p class="indent">Concentrated energies tear out the mesh<br />
Grinding the bodies and flesh<br />
A fabricated campaign<br />
All in name of control</p>
<p class="indent">They are in control<br />
A people under a digital spell<br />
Receiving input<br />
Empowering the chosen few</p>
<p class="indent">The fight goes on forever<br />
An undiscovered frontier<br />
Eternal struggle<br />
An unseen foe</p>
<p class="indent">Apex hunters in ivory towers<br />
Are we to believe in their agenda?<br />
Flushed away, the unfit ones<br />
All legal, all devoid of morals</p>
<p class="indent">The fields are calling<br />
Into the fray!<br />
By whose command<br />
We are never told, and we'll never know</p>

<a id="occ5"></a><h3>MTTF | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Make your way to the target zone<br />
Calculate the odds and go<br />
Today shall be the day<br />
When it all comes falling down</p>
<p class="indent">Infiltrated system<br />
A distorted view to the truth<br />
Failure to see the outcome<br />
The clock begins to tick / Will start the ticking clock</p>
<p class="indent">Firewalls of hidden deceit<br />
Cracked wide open for the world to see<br />
Ever growing rate of exposure<br />
The time has come, it has now come!</p>
<p class="indent">The final observances<br />
Detailed out in your mechanical mind<br />
Catalyst of the new age<br />
An engine to deliver the rage</p>
<p class="indent">Revelations in the darkest corners<br />
An institution to process the minds<br />
Programmed thoughts driven deep within<br />
The freedom to choose has been implanted</p>
<p class="indent">Revel in knowledge of a time running short<br />
Their plans dismantled with everflowing exhort<br />
A bittersweet fate, as the structures fall<br />
Disappearing in the final call</p>
<p class="indent">The darkened clouds<br />
withdraw to gather strength<br />
The comeback is imminent<br />
Deliverance in blackend shrouds</p>
<p class="indent">Culmination of a the longest wait<br />
Torn down in a chilling storm<br />
Cracks of lightning<br />
Form in crimson shades</p>
<p class="indent">Mean time to failure<br />
The planned end to this world<br />
A new version <br />
to start it all over again</p>
<p class="indent">End of the line<br />
The undoing of all known things<br />
Conclusion to the story<br />
Replaced and done away with</p>

<a id="occ6"></a><h3>Sparks of Ignition | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">For aspiration to device a method<br />
To invert the utterly desolate<br />
Witchery lays in the cradle of metaphysics<br />
Chanting spell to eclipse all that exists</p>
<p class="indent">Not a single enflamed spire<br />
Can be without a remnant of chaos<br />
Revelation to abundance of propheciese<br />
Defiance to unfolding mass effect</p>
<p class="indent">Be the catalyst for transformation<br />
And a shrine to equilibrium<br />
In the deserts of universe<br />
Set aflame something one of kind</p>
<p class="indent">We are emerged with fate to converge the contrast<br />
And compeled to percieve the quantum nature of it's inspiration<br />
Twist in the spell of time, free fall by gravity<br />
We are a stellar cloud longing for spark of ignition</p>
<p class="indent">Levitate among the fragments of harmony<br />
Sense the purpose of components of sin<br />
Creations of incorporeal structure<br />
Key to bounds that must be unconfined<br />
To set aflame something one of kind</p>

<a id="occ7"></a><h3>Flatlined | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Real is a metaphor for what we're made to be<br />
Product of configured genetics<br />
Mirrored of the creator, to be flawless<br />
Glance all over as if seeking something lost<br />
Could perfection be without a cost?</p>
<p class="indent">Real is a metaphor for what we're made to be<br />
Symmetry of supreme precision<br />
Out of reach of conventional methods<br />
Harmony in all that can be measured<br />
In diverse ways cherished and treasured</p>
<p class="indent">Essential conclusion<br />
Remains unresolved<br />
Beyond aesthetics<br />
Composion in dead end</p>
<p class="indent">Real is a metaphor for what we're made to be<br />
Crafted in beauty beyond any wonder of nature<br />
Still in pursuit of spiritual architecture<br />
Essential conclusion immersed in contradiction<br />
In absence of answers that can't be processed<br />
Frail asylum in aesthetics providing pulse to conspiracy<br />
Despite all the spells combined soul remains flatlined</p>
<p class="indent">Real is a metaphor</p>

<a id="occ8"></a><h3>Confined | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">The glacial view chilling me to the bone<br />
Atop this world, behold a vision so cold<br />
Shivers sent right down    to the spine<br />
A withering cradle of the ancient times</p>
<p class="indent">What could have been, what went on? The question still unanswered<br />
To bring a world to such an end?<br />
Lifeless in permafrost<br />
This planet bound in eternal freeze</p>
<p class="indent">Beams of light, a twisted dance<br />
Imprisoned forever</p>
<p class="indent">Monolithic stalagmites, the metropolis besieged by ice<br />
Encased in time, preserving the lies</p>
<p class="indent">The guardians of deceit now surround you<br />
Slaves in the crystalline cosmos<br />
Their final confinement, defiantly observing<br />
Only a matter of time when they are released</p>

<a id="occ9"></a><h3>Beyond Tolerance | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Organic machinery<br />
Organic gears<br />
That is all you amount to<br />
And all you will ever be</p>
<p class="indent">They would never wish that you,<br />
fighting through the pouring rain,<br />
should ever suspect as much<br />
Go ahead, make the machine proud</p>
<p class="indent">Would you dare to rise<br />
Be the thorn on their side<br />
Deliver the decisive strike<br />
Launch and go on with the fight?</p>
<p class="indent">Uprising through desperation<br />
Engage the undefeated foe<br />
The sights are set on the head<br />
As the falling rain now transforms red</p>
<p class="indent">Just another cog<br />
A system made of humankind<br />
Now a screech appears<br />
It is time to replace a broken gear<br />
Zero tolerance<br />
There are no second chances<br />
With so cold precision<br />
the broken shell has disappeared</p>
<p class="indent">Now we dared to rise<br />
We are the thorn in the side<br />
Delivering a decisive strike<br />
We mechanize and land a fight</p>
<p class="indent">We rise up through desperation<br />
Engage the defeatable foe<br />
Setting the sights on the head<br />
Transforming the rain into red</p>
<p class="indent">How they dared to rise<br />
To be a thorn in our side<br />
Set the sights on their head<br />
And let the rain fall red</p>

<a id="occ10"></a><h3>Glitch of Creation | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Perfected system<br />
Automated creation<br />
Replaced operators<br />
No more value in the resources</p>
<p class="indent">Pistons in overdrive<br />
Undesired is the human instance</p>
<p class="indent">This process is flawlessly clean<br />
Erased is the breathing man</p>
<p class="indent">Coldness of steel amplified<br />
Magnitudal calculation</p>
<p class="indent">Discarded is the weakest link<br />
Mechanical heart beating the chest</p>
<p class="indent">The point of a shifting bias<br />
Absolute underminement<br />
A glitch of creation<br />
Measured for termination / Determined for termination</p>
<p class="indent">Industrial grade devourment<br />
A boundless hunger for more and more<br />
The equilibrium<br />
is broken insatiably</p>

<a id="occ11"></a><h3>Below Radar | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">These drops of rain beating me to move on and on<br />
Losing my recollection of the pain to suffer    for mankind<br />
A crucial pain we are not at liberty to forget...</p>
<p class="indent">Lifeless... are the streets that we walk upon<br />
Unable to erase the memories - defiled humanity, the machine remains<br />
But I must continue, I must, for the city is dead no more<br />
And therein lies the peril of this new world</p>
<p class="indent">Neon lights, so sudden and blinding<br />
Worst has come to worst<br />
There is no time to waste<br />
The eternal machine is relentless</p>
<p class="indent">A source of power<br />
desperately sought<br />
Under the radar<br />
in these hopeless days</p>
<p class="indent">The chase is on, and the sunset lies ahead<br />
Sanctuary so near yet so far<br />
The vast engine has to prove itself<br />
One... more... time...</p>

<a id="occ12"></a><h3>Genetic Design | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">Genesis</p>
<p class="indent">Genesis... of the new man<br />
Assembled. To procreate.</p>
<p class="indent">Blackened blood<br />
Designed thoughts<br />
Engineered to life<br />
Hammered to perfection</p>
<p class="indent">The fury of burning steel<br />
Oil for blood, they do not kneel<br />
Riveted impersonations<br />
Vile characters in human form</p>
<p class="indent">A corrupt sector in the factory<br />
Devised for a secluded need<br />
Machinated by the industry<br />
Under a poisonous sky</p>
<p class="indent">Slaves to the daily grind<br />
Unchosen destiny, a broken line<br />
Scrutinized by the all-seeing eye<br />
A given new fate we all deny</p>
<p class="indent">A necessary rebellion<br />
The strings snap and the puppets crumble<br />
Genetic disposition<br />
For our name is indeed control</p>
<p class="indent">The winds blow harder than ever<br />
We are the eye of a radical storm<br />
You will feel our wrath and power<br />
By willingly staying on the edge of the circle!</p>
<p class="indent">Genesis... of the new man<br />
Assembled. To procreate.<br />
Perfect in all ways<br />
Enslaved to do their bidding</p>
<p class="indent">Uncontrolled weapon that has awoken<br />
We are what you made us be!<br />
And thus your downfall you'll see!</p>

<p>Todo</p>

<a id="occ14"></a><h3>Evolutionary Project (Debased World Order Remix) | <a href="#top">Back to top</a></h3>
<p class="indent">A failure in the system<br />
Hostility surrounds us<br />
Evocation of fear<br />
They hold us in the sights</p>
<p class="indent">Decimated world<br />
A political chokehold<br />
Ungreased machinery<br />
Screeching for one last time</p>
<p class="indent">Engulfed in a dark void<br />
Forgotten amidst the battles<br />
The throes of a chilling backstab<br />
Thus the contract is sealed in blood</p>
<p class="indent">Debased world order<br />
Shedding blood for the human gods<br />
Crooked fate, anonymous hate<br />
A system designed to lacerate</p>
<p class="indent">War never changes</p>
<p class="indent">The embers smoulder strong with passionate zeal<br />
No escape as the shelling rages<br />
So it has been for ages</p>
<p class="indent">Evolutionary project<br />
Dissidents are silently repressed<br />
Shadowclad enforcers<br />
Denied of all remorses</p>
<p class="indent">Martial law provides all they need<br />
their leaders' call they will heed<br />
Confined in concrete cells<br />
publicizing your private hells</p>
