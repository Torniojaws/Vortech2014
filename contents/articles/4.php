		<p>OCTOBER 22nd 2006</p>
		<p>Things are progressing still and I have actually composed a little more and tweaked a few older songs to become practically completely new songs. I still have four songs left to edit and change, and then it is finally time to start recording all the songs after a long wait!</p>
		<p>OCTOBER 12th 2006</p>
		<p>It's taking a bit longer since I want make the songs structurally as best as I can get them, so I'm taking my town to be sure about the songs being perfect. I've added quite a bit of electronics now to about half the songs, and they are sounding very sweet right now.</p>
		<p>SEPTEMBER 22nd 2006</p>
		<p>Things are progressing well, and I've got the first half and the ending of the album pretty much cleared tracklist-wise. I've got 3 songs left to polish up to the final form before I start recording everything into finished songs.</p>
		<p>SEPTEMBER 17th 2006</p>
		<p>There's now lyrics to about half the songs, but there's still some minor changes happening most likely. I also managed to compose one new song too, and it's sounding very nice. The preliminary title for that song is "Within the Fog"</p>
		<p>SEPTEMBER 1st 2006</p>
		<p>The majority of the arrangements are now done, and I'm starting to concentrate more fully into the lyrics, and this part is also fairly uneventful, so updates might be a little more scarce.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 26th 2006</p>
		<p>Finally, the songs are now fully demoed and the less good songs have now been dropped leaving a tight package of 11 songs at 37:43 with also a preliminary running order. Now I'm starting to write the lyrics into the songs and make any final adjustments possibly needed (probably not). Stay tuned for final updates before the recording begins!</p>
		<p>AUGUST 21st 2006</p>
		<p>There haven't been updates for a while since this part of song making is very uneventful. I've now got just two tracks left to re-arrange and program fully, and then it's finally time to start recording the real guitars. I also managed to compose another new song today and it's kicking nicely.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 15th 2006</p>
		<p>It's now the second phase of pre-production, and that's re-arranging the songs into nice and tight packages, with some minor riff changes here and there. Also, the 90% final drums will be programmed now. So far two songs have been fully gone through: A.I. and Anthropomorph (going through the songs alphabetically).</p>
		<p>AUGUST 13th 2006</p>
		<p>Alright, there are now 13 songs fully demoed, totaling in at 46 minutes 15 seconds. Now I'll keep listening to the tracks for a while and taking notes about any ideas or changes and such, especially the structures. Once this process is finished, I will start recording the songs properly.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 12th 2006</p>
		<p>There's now 10 riffs on Instigate Hostile Reaction, so I should be able to finish it up tomorrow, making a preliminary structure to it. Then it leaves just one song left to demo out and I should have 13 songs and about 40-45 minutes of material for the album.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 11th 2006</p>
		<p>I continued work on the new track Instigate Hostile Reaction. I changed the chorus a bit and added a very nice lead guitar melody to it, which made it remind me a bit of Terra Ultimatum from the previous album. It still needs a kicking first riff to make the song a very nice piece, so that's what I'll continue working on tomorrow.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 10th 2006</p>
		<p>Today was especially efficient day, I managed to demo out four songs: "...In Silence" and "Wasteland Roamers", both dark ambient pieces, and then "The Core" + "Lord of Worms", both which are very hard hitters and thrashy pieces which should please you too ;) That means I now have 11 full songs demoed measuring in at 35:40 with two songs still left to finish.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 9th 2006</p>
		<p>I managed to compose four riffs to a new song called "Instigate Hostile Reaction" (Hello, Mr Leeb :D) which is turning out quite progressive in the Meshuggah ways. I also put together a nice dark ambient piece called "...In Silence", and it should really sit nicely in the album entirety bringing a haunting memory of a nuclear war. Very evil and eerie melodies.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 8th 2006</p>
		<p>Nothing much happened today, but I did finish the preliminary drum programmings into Xenomorph Realm and changed some of the riffs a little. So far the song is sounding nice, and the chorus will have a nice oriental feeling continuing a little bit in the vein of Judgement of the Amenti. Hang tight.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 7th 2006</p>
		<p>I managed to fully demo the song Blood Tribunal and it's currently kicking nicely. A nice and twisted chorus, with some heavy deluxe shredding inbetween and a concise form to add a cherry on top of it. I also added four additional riffs to the second song I started working on yesterday (Xenomorph Realm), and it now has 8 groovin' riffs, so I should be able to demo it up tomorrow.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 6th 2006</p>
		<p>I got my guitar gear back from our rehearsal space today, so I started fiddling with two new songs with working titles of "Blood Tribunal" and "Xenomorph Realm" The latter progressed especially well and should turn out a fairly thrashy piece. Continuing the work on them tomorrow.</p>
		<p>AUGUST 5th 2006</p>
		<p>Well, it's weird starting this from halfway the sessions, but anyway: So far 7 songs have been completed demoing-wise, but some of them are far from being complete when it comes to arrangements. That's what I'll be working on next, to bring the songs together as a nice and tight package. A lot of the stuff is much faster than the stuff on Conclusion, but you'll recognize the band ;) Here's the rundown on currently finished songs:</p>
		<p>A.I. (172 bpm)</p>
		Most likely the album starter song, starts off with a fast fast shred going into a groovy chorus and continuing on a grindy riff &amp; then a groovy Sol Niger Within riff</p>
		<p>Anthromorph (250 bpm)</p>
		Again a fast start. Goes into a little bit more groovier time signatures with leads prominent. Watch out for a cliffside lead part near the end :P</p>
		<p>Impulse (235 bpm)</p>
		This is song is still quite unfinished structurally, but it features pretty rough riffing with some nice back-kicking ride work in a tricky time sig. And onto shredding.</p>
		<p>Ominous Dawn (245 bpm)</p>
		One of the oldest songs of the bunch, written a few months after Conclusion, a very tight grindy song.</p>
		<p>Perdition (257 bpm)</p>
		A fast one once more, with a very Arcturus-que chorus featuring a haunting lead melody. </p>
		<p>The Remnants of Apocalypse (270 bpm)</p>
		So you couldn't get enough of fast ones? Here's some more... lively riffing in a little bit of old Soilwork stuff reminding stuff here and there. </p>
		<p>Wasteland Roamers (80 bpm)</p>
		This one's an eerie enough dark ambient style track with lots of haunting sounds of unknown</p>
