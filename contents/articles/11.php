		<p>Impenitence was born during the songwriting sessions for the album "The Occlusion", after the sessions left the band with a selection of songs too good to be left unreleased. The result is another EP in quick succession, presenting the band at their most experimental. The aim of the EP is to really push the boundaries for the band, and see where the sound can be taken to, while still staying mostly true to the core of the experience.</p>
		<p>With the new direction selected for the album, the road was made clear for a whole array of new songs to do. Armed with new methods to write them, the inspiration netted 7 songs throughout the year 2012 and they would form the main body of the album. A further 6 songs were finalized in early 2013, bringing the total song count to a far larger number than on any previous writing sessions. As all the songs had turned out to be of high quality, there was little room for leaving anything out. That led to the decision to also make a new EP, Impenitence, which would continue the idea of keeping the more experimental tracks on EPs.</p>
		<p>Finally, when we were happy with how the demo versions sounded like, and the close to final tracklist was chosen, it would naturally be time to start recording the album. As has been the habit with most of the previous albums, this one would turn out to be just as quick to record as ever! Within the space of a mere 14 non-stop hours of recording, all the guitars for 18 songs were completed: 4 rhythm tracks, plus 1-3 lead guitar tracks per song. Not too shabby! As these songs are more about the industrial and cold feel, we decided to also tighten the stuff up with some extra studio magic, for that final extra oomph and razor-sharpness often associated with industrial. Another new thing for us!</p>
