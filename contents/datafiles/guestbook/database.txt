Juha|@Charlie: Most of the synths are from VST instruments such as Nexus, Korg Legacy, Imposcar, Junglist and z3ta+. And you're in for a suprise with the next release, if you like synths! :)|2013-05-14|20:00|
Charlie|Hi! I am currently listening to your &quot;Devoid of Life&quot; album. It kicks ass! What do you use for the synths?! It adds awesome atmospheres. Keep rockin' and releasing!|2013-04-25|21:18|
Matt|Thanks for the music downloads, will buy a Tee when I got the cash.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Keep up the awesome music!|2013-02-01|17:30|

﻿alexey|Вы охуенная группа!!! С нетерпением жду ваших новых релизов. Удачи и вдохновения!|2011-11-01|20:00|
Jona|Looking forward to the next album a lot. I think it would be great if you also released backing tracks for the drums and keys maybe? Cheers. Hail Vortech!|2011-08-21|12:32|
Mataï|Good and interesting band. Hope you will keep on playing great music. Btw, I'm reviewer and I contact personnally contact Juha in Facebook...hope you receive my message...|2011-07-09|18:15|
Unknown|Good band, I think they need to work on the riffs a little more.|2011-07-02|02:36|
Jona|I hope Matti has got his growling guts ready.|2010-12-15|18:15|
Didac|Spain awaits the last release :D|2010-12-04|04:19|
VortechFan|The faster the BPM, the more I love it! Shedding The Flesh is the best song in the entire world.|2010-11-24|22:54|
SurfaceX|SurfaceX here from Chicago IL USA i dig the atomic amount of energy in your music! your Sybreeds main competition!  V|2010-11-15|04:24|
Dmitriy|You did not think about how artificially lower the vocal timbre?? And add some vocoders to growling. I think it should be interesting. D'n'B mix 'the core', I cannot wait anymore!   Lock and load all your vocals  until your fans shall fall by tons )))|2010-10-17|14:09|
Jona|Looking forward to the next album very much! Goodluck with vocals!|2010-08-17|22:15|

Dmitriy Ukraine|Hi man! Can you upload video about writing &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;The Black Rite&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;? Solo in video &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Songwriting&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; in y-tube is amazing! We're waining for new album!!! Yeeah!  m/|2010-05-13|00:07|
TheLastSucker|The new song titles for your fifth album are fucking amazing as always. Futuristic space melodies with annihilating armageddon sound. Vortech incinerates! m/|2010-05-02|20:19|
Jona|Looking forward to the next album but no need to rush. Take your time dudes. It will be awesome no doubt.|2010-04-05|19:56|
Jona|The main riff on Conclusions &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Mind Awakening&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; is amazing! Vortech is king of industrial metal.|2010-03-28|22:40|
Juha|On Conclusion, it's just single drum samples triggered with Battery VST.|2010-01-27|02:21|
Dmitriy Ukraine|Hi man!  Today I listen &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Conclusion&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; all my working time non-stop and I think it is most interesting album (no your great's solo, but interesting  songs structure). If you &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; your friend remake vocals it will be awesome! I hear influences of Fear Factory,but you made it better.  Do you use addictive drums? Or another plugin? I cannot regulate &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;kick&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; for such good sound...sor for my english)|2010-01-26|22:58|
espo|Thanks for the discog fellas! absolutely fucking crushing!|2010-01-04|16:27|
Juha|No, I haven't, but I will check it out, it seems interesting.|2009-12-18|00:37|

Juha|All the lyrics are available in the Releases section. There's a link below each album image.|2009-12-14|11:06|
Dmitriy Ukraine|Hi man!  I like ur music very much! Especially guitar solo is great! Where i can find lyrics? i wanna little karaoke ;)|2009-12-13|23:53|
Jona|Frozen Machine is a-mazing. Your composing skills have seemingly transcended mortals. Another album for spring 2010? AWESOME, you manage to make regular great albums that rule, skills! I think you should try some remixes of the best Vortech material, including this. Maybe as ambient/dance track with the epic synths.  If the rest of the album lives up to &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Frozen...&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; will definately need to buy it.   HAIL VORTECH!|2009-11-20|17:49|
Baz|You blow me away guys, i just love your sound.|2009-09-25|00:58|
TheLastSucker|Already starting to compose new material? o.O  You are bloody awesome!  Can't fucking wait for a new futuristic armageddon magnum opus! m/|2009-06-29|22:52|

You truly created a masterpiece with this album, and I've been recommending it whenever possible.  Kudos on creating such a masterpiece!|2009-06-18|07:51|

Jonus|Juha is genius and kraken has some of the most brutal vocals ever. The conclusion vocals were great also strange electro-whispers, i hope Juha does more like that.|2009-03-25|15:17|
Jonus|Posthumanism will rule the earth!!  Vortech = ownage. Better than most crappy signed bands.|2009-03-25|15:15|

Wintergrindgod|pls upload some videoclips ^^|2009-03-03|15:00|
Juha|The three posted songs were written one after another during three days :) The other songs are quite different, but since Xenomorphosis was requested, that's what I uploaded.|2009-01-05|16:05|
TheLastSucker|Xenomorphosis is gorgeous! But I have to admit seriously ( I know you are not even finished with the record!)that your three posted demos slightly sound the same. Don't get me wrong I LOVE them! But I wanted to give you this pointso that you maybe can improve and make the record another magnum opus!|2009-01-05|14:57|
