1|torniojaws|OMINOUS DAWN|So, with the new album having been out for a few months now, it is time to look forward and continue work towards the next event in time. A new release has been in the works for a while now, with 11 incomplete songs being currently worked on, hopefully for a release in autumn. Some of the working titles include, in alphabetical order:<br /><br />"Anthromorph", "Impulse", "Infra Red Seekers", "Lord of Worms", "Memoirs of A.I.", "Ominous Dawn", "Perdition", "Rift Vision", "System Boot Failure", "The Core", "Wasteland Roamers"<br /><br />While waiting for that, the winds of change tear down the foundations and thus a new site is built on the ground zero of old. I present this new form of information center.|2006-07-05 10:05|

5|torniojaws|CONCLUSION ALSO AT LAST.FM|Well, some of you have noticed it a while ago, but here's a more official version. The entire album is previewable at Last.fm here: <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Vortech/Conclusion">http://www.last.fm/music/Vortech/Conclusion</a><br /><br />In other news, I'm pretty near of the final structures for the songs. There's a total of 15 songs and a few of them will probably be dropped off from the final album, but I haven't decided fully which songs to drop. It's turning out quite nice, being a good continuation and progression on Conclusion. The songs are a lot more aggressive and faster overall. The basic premise for the album is a plane right before, during and after a nuclear war after which only a wasteland is left for the survivors to roam about. Stay tuned ;)|2006-11-03 20:04|
6|torniojaws|RECORDING TO BEGIN|It seems I have now finished all the songs up, and it's time to start recording the guitars properly. The recordings will begin at the end of December, and I should have all guitars recorded by early January. Then it's time to program the final synth thingies and such. Lastly, I will record all vocals at an appropriate time sometime in January. The album will be mixed in late January, and all should be done by February if all goes smoothly. Check back for more news, and perhaps some pictures and videos from the recording sessions!<br /><br />And lastly, here's the currently planned tracklist and durations. The song titles will change after the final storyline is done:<br /><br />01. The Core (2:25)<br />02. System Failure (4:54)<br />03. Anthropomorph (3:48)<br />04. Instigate Hostile Reaction (4:41)<br />05. Impulse (3:54)<br />06. Perdition (2:49)<br />07. The Silence (3:43)<br />08. Artificial (2:58)<br />09. Venomous Sky (3:03)<br />10. Radiant Storm (3:15)<br />11. Wasteland Roamers (4:36)<br /><br />Total length 40:04|2006-12-01 22:40|
7|torniojaws|MERRY GIFTMAS|So, just in time for the celebrations, I just wanted to inform you that I'm currently setting up a new forum for our bands (Vortech and Coldway). This one will be based on phpBB2, so it will be a much better and usable one for all sorts of posting. A variety of user choosable skins are also added :) More info coming later on.<br /><br />Ja sama suomeksi. Eli pist宠juuri uutta foorumia kasaan Vortechille ja Coldwaylle, phpBB2-pohjaisena. Mukaan tulee l嫤 vaihdettavia ulkoasuja, ja k庴ett巹ys paranee muutenkin. Tarkempaa infoa tulee my򨥭min.<br /><br /><br />Update:<br />The forum is now online! Have fun :)<br /><a href="http://user.personal.fi/musiikki/torniojaws/phpBB2/">http://user.personal.fi/musiikki/torniojaws/phpBB2/</a>|2006-12-24 19:25|
8|torniojaws|RECORDING UPDATE, Part 1|Greetings again. I have now finished recording 25% of all the guitars, and it's sounding nice so far :) I hope to finish all the guitars for three more songs tomorrow, and I will most likely be done by this weekend. I have also filmed a few video clips and taken some pictures, which I will add to the site once I've gone through them. Stay tuned for more updates!|2007-01-03 19:04|
9|torniojaws|DAY 2 IN STUDIO|Alright, just as I hoped yesterday, I managed to record all the guitars for three more songs, and now there's just three songs left to record, and all guitars are done! Tomorrow I'll also record the fastest song on the album, Perdition, which is basically 3 minutes of almost non-stop bombing at 258 bpm :) Not that any of the other songs are slow, either... heh.<br /><br />Hopefully I'll manage to record all the remaining three songs tomorrow :) Over and out.|2007-01-04 17:54|
10|torniojaws|DAY 3 (Part 1)|Here are some pictures from the previous days:<br /><br /><a href="img/studio_2007_1.jpg"><img src="img/studio_2007_1_thumb.jpg" alt="Vortech @ studio 2007"/></a> <a href="img/studio_2007_2.jpg"><img src="img/studio_2007_2_thumb.jpg" alt="Vortech @ studio 2007"/></a> <a href="img/studio_2007_3.jpg"><img src="img/studio_2007_3_thumb.jpg" alt="Vortech @ studio 2007"/></a> <a href="img/studio_2007_4.jpg"><img src="img/studio_2007_4_thumb.jpg" alt="Vortech @ studio 2007"/></a> <a href="img/studio_2007_5.jpg"><img src="img/studio_2007_5_thumb.jpg" alt="Vortech @ studio 2007"/></a> <a href="img/studio_2007_6.jpg"><img src="img/studio_2007_6_thumb.jpg" alt="Vortech @ studio 2007"/></a>|2007-01-05 10:04|
11|torniojaws|DAY 3 (Part 2)|Alright, I managed to record the guitar for two more songs, but unfortunately our band training with my other band Coldway took a little more time, so I couldn't finish the guitars for the final song. I'll record the last one tomorrow morning, and then I have all guitars done!|2007-01-05 20:34|
12|torniojaws|DAY 4|And we're done! All guitars have now been recorded. The next step is doing the vocals, and it should keep me busy until February. There may be a few surprises, if things work out, so watch out! ;)|2007-01-06 13:18|
13|torniojaws|BASSIC INFO|Alright, all bass lines have been finalized now and are ready for mixing. I'm still working on the vocals and lyrics.|2007-01-09 10:16|
14|torniojaws|THROATY...|The lyrics are now pretty much done for 5 songs. I will try to finish all the lyrics this weekend and begin recording in early February or so.|2007-01-19 17:11|
15|torniojaws|LYRICS FROM THE WASTELAND|Alright, all the lyrics are now finished! The remaining work is to tweak them a little for best impact and flow. It's also my birthday today ;) But some updates will follow soon, as I finish the lyrics.|2007-02-09 22:57|
16|torniojaws|UPDATES FOR FEBRUARY|Alright, the vocals seem to be coming along soon, courtesy of a currently unnamed person :) The name will be revealed later on just to keep you on your toes. In other news, I have finished making the new layout for this website and it should be live very soon! It features a lot of new content, and even some articles about previous releases. A nice look in the past to see what was done. The album artwork has also been finished, so stick around for that too...|2007-02-25 07:17|
17|torniojaws|NEW ALBUM INFORMATION|Alright, the album is almost finished. It is called Wasteland, and it talks about the times before, during and after a worldwide nuclear war. The last things left to do before the release are recording the vocals and mixing it. Here is the album cover and the final tracklist. You can click on the album cover to view a full size version:<br /><br /><a href="img/cd-full-wasteland.jpg"><img src="img/cd-wasteland.jpg" alt="Wasteland" class="levy"/></a><br /><br />01. The Core<br />02. Evolutionary Project<br />03. Their Contract<br />04. Instigate Hostile Reaction<br />05. Impulse<br />06. Perdition<br />07. The Silence<br />08. Winds of Contamination<br />09. Radiant Storm<br />10. Wasteland Roamers<br /><br />Here's also a small 32 seconds long teaser clip from the track Impulse. This sample isn't the final mix.<br /><br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech/impulse-teaser.mp3">Impulse</a> (918 kB)<br /><br />And as you may have noticed, the website has now been updated! Enjoy the new content, such as album diaries/looks in the past :)<br /><br />PS.<br />I've also started a new dark ambient project called Cryonity, which you can check out at <a href="http://www.mikseri.net/cryonity">http://www.mikseri.net/cryonity</a>. In the vein of Deutsch Nepal, Delerium and Mark Snow.|2007-03-03 09:25|
18|torniojaws|Instrumental mixes finished|While waiting for the vocals to be finished, I did a preliminary mix for the album and it's sounding very nice right now :) The mix sounds a little bit like Terror 2000's Faster Disaster when compared to some other albums. I'm very happy how it turned out, so now it's just a waiting game until the vocals are done and can be added to the mixes. Hopefully the album can be released sometime in April or May. See ya...|2007-03-15 17:47|
19|torniojaws|Changes in commenting|Alright, since there's no good way to prevent those damn spambots, I removed commenting from the news. From now on, please post comments to the new guestbook or just join our forum :) And then about Wasteland; It seems that the guest vocals aren't going to happen, so I will start recording the vocals probably next weekend.|2007-03-31 09:29|
20|torniojaws|Vocals... revisited|Looks like some of the vocals will in fact happen, and not just by one person - but two! Stay tuned for more information soon. If all goes well, it seems that the first half of the songs will have one and the second half of the album will have another vocalist, with me filling the gaps.|2007-04-04 11:49|
21|torniojaws|About the mp3 server and forum|Looks like the service provider is finally explaining the constant outages: money. Their own internet provider has asked a lot more money, and that surprised them. So, right now they're cut off for the time being. I guess I'll start looking for a different place to host my mp3s and the forum in.<br /><br />And finally, some more info about the new album. The second vocalist should start recording his parts soon.<br /><br />UPDATE, 17 April<br /><br />The mp3s are now back. A big thanks goes to -Gavin- at Ultimate Metal! :) Still working on a good solution for the forum. Perhaps I'll just remove it and maybe expand the guestbook.|2007-04-15 16:39|
22|torniojaws|Vocal works|The other guest vocalist has finally fixed his gear and can now begin recording his vocals. Hopefully it won't take too long anymore, so I can release the album :) In other news, I've already started doing some inital work towards the next album. About half of the lyrics have now been finished. This time I'll try a different approach, doing the lyrics first and the music afterwards. We'll see what will come from this.|2007-04-29 10:12|
23|torniojaws|Brand, shining-new layout|As you probably have noticed, the website received a small facelift this weekend, all in preparation for the upcoming release. There are a few things that look different with a browser that supports PNG alpha channels, so check the site out with one (Firefox, Opera, IE7, etc). Also, if you see some odd things, try refreshing the site. But meanwhile, enjoy the new site while waiting for some updates in the near future. The second guest vocalist has unfortunately been sick for a while and he may not be able to do the vocals.|2007-05-12 15:29|
24|torniojaws|Receiving some vocal tracks|I'm currently downloading the first batch of finished vocals from the second guest vocalist. Can't wait to hear what he's come up with :) Once I've checked them and approved them, I'll start mixing the song up. From there on, it should be all nice and dandy to add the other vocals. Maybe this baby will finally see the light of day, heh :)|2007-05-19 20:13|
25|torniojaws|First track mixed|The first track with the new vocals has been mixed. I've got the vocals for another track too, and I'll put them into the song and mix it tomorrow. So far they're sounding very nice :)|2007-05-20 21:00|
26|torniojaws|Second track mixed|The tracks "Their Contract" and "Impulse" now have full vocals in them. "The Core" also has nearly complete vocals, courtesy of Closure. I'll have to do some minor parts for the song to complete it. That leaves five more tracks without vocals, of which Kraku will do three more. Hopefully I can finish my vocal parts this week.|2007-05-21 19:25|
27|torniojaws|Third mixed song|Alright, just received some more vocals and now Perdition has full vocals and mix. Not many songs left anymore, and thus the release gets closer by the day.|2007-06-08 21:09|
28|torniojaws|And another!|Alright, I just finished mixing Evolutionary Project, and I also have the tracks for two more songs. I should be able to finish them tomorrow, leaving only one and a half songs! There might be one more guest vocalist doing some clean vox to the track Instigate Hostile Reaction, so stay tuned ;)|2007-06-18 19:43|
29|torniojaws|One more track finished|I managed to finish Radiant Storm today. That leaves Instigate Hostile Reaction for tomorrow, but that's also the track that will possibly feature some clean vocals so I can't do a final mix of it yet. Things are looking good right now overall :)|2007-06-19 19:22|
30|torniojaws|Winds of Contamination|Well, it wasn't Instigate after all, but Winds of Contamination. Anyways, it's finished now. That leaves just the aforementioned one and a half songs left to do. While I've been waiting for the vocals to be finished, I've actually composed two brand new songs that will probably be on the next Vortech album due out sometime in 2008. The two songs feature more melody, more speed and more brutality it seems, so hang tight ;) The first song features some of the fastest stuff I've done so far, at 310 bpm :D Human limits? Human schmimitz!|2007-06-25 14:26|
31|torniojaws|Final vocals this week|I just got the word from Kraken that he might finish his final vocals this week, maybe by friday already. That would leave just the possible clean vocal feature for Instigate Hostile Reaction, and Closure's vocals for The Core remaining to do.<br /><br />But I will be at the Tuska festival (Emperor <img src="img/headbang.gif" alt="Whee"/>) this weekend so I can't do the final mixes yet. Perhaps I can have the album ready for a release by the end of next week, if all goes well :)|2007-06-27 18:45|
32|torniojaws|Not so fast, buddy!|Well, unfortunately things didn't work out so I'll have to wait for a bit more. Apparently the two fellas are doing something this weekend, so hopefully they'll be able to finish the song :)|2007-07-07 15:08|
33|torniojaws|In case you were disappointed|Here's a brand new Vortech demo song :) The title is "The Six Phases of Unrest" and it's basically about a dream gone wrong, with sudden phase-outs to something entirely different. Hope you enjoy the track while waiting for Wasteland to be finished. This track will very likely be on the next Vortech album after Wasteland.<br /><br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech_six.mp3">http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech_six.mp3</a> (6.53 MB)|2007-07-07 21:25|
34|torniojaws|Spambot strike|Looks like an advertisement bot flooded up the comments section of the news program and made that error come up. It's fixed now.|2007-07-19 14:18|
35|torniojaws|Well, well, what do you know|Looks like the old pain in the butt is back online, but we'll see for how long. You can once again get to our forum at:<br /><a href="http://user.personal.fi/musiikki/torniojaws/forum/">http://user.personal.fi/musiikki/torniojaws/forum/</a><br /><br />But there's no guarantee for how long Personal.fi will work this time. Enjoy while you can ;)|2007-07-21 07:22|
36|torniojaws|Brand new layout!|As I promised in the forum, here you have the brand new website layout with much added content! Also, the problems you occasionally saw with IE6 have been fixed. I've tested the site with Firefox 2.0.0.5, Opera 9.22 and Internet Explorer 6 SP1 with all updates, and everything has worked fine even after intentionally trying to break the layout :D <br /><br />Go and browse around for new stuff. The studio diaries have been updated, there's a whole section of brand new print-size album artwork files and the guestbook has been updated a bit. Have fun. Oh and the usual deal: if you see something strange in the layout, try force-refreshing with Ctrl + F5|2007-07-21 10:14|
37|torniojaws|Some changes|While waiting for Kraken and Daedolon to finish their vocal stuff, I decided to record a real bass to all the songs on Wasteland. And that's what I did. I started this morning at around 11:30 and finished at 16:00. Nice and swift, heh. Oh, I also had a gig with Relativity on Friday at Oulu, and it went pretty nicely. I also got to meet Kraken and Daedolon face to face. What a strange bunch ;)|2007-08-05 14:12|
38|torniojaws|The time draws nearer...|I finished doing the final mixes with vocals and everything for 8 songs today. I'm going to do some small additional vocals on "The Core" to finish that song up, and Kraken has promised to finish his vocals on the last remaining song next week. Hopefully this time it works out and I can finally do the last touches for the album. As for the mix, it's sounding very kickin' and delightfully raw at the moment. Can't wait to release this baby :)|2007-08-11 20:15|
39|torniojaws|Futuristic|That's what I'd say about this fifth new song that I wrote :) Things are progressing nicely with 20 minutes of new material ready at this point. A second bunch of new stuff still needs to be done over time and I should have a very nice release ready once more. Which leads us to Wasteland. I sent Daedolon some clean vocal demo lines and he'll do those at his studio sometime soon. Should provide a nice edge to the track Instigate Hostile Reaction. That's the last one remaining at this point.|2007-08-16 17:58|
40|torniojaws|Updates for August|Well, looks like it didn't work out. I guess I'll have to record the vocals myself, probably tomorrow morning. Anyways, there's now seven new demo songs and exactly 30 minutes of material for the next Vortech album. I'm going to do three more songs and possibly some intermission electronic things or maybe some more ambient and then start writing the lyrics for them. At the same time, I'll probably start recording all the DI tracks for the songs and see where it goes from there. Maybe I'll have them reamped or just use an amp emulator again.|2007-08-25 09:39|
41|torniojaws|Two tracks available from Wasteland!|Alright, I just uploaded two tracks from Wasteland to Mikseri.net and Myspace. Check 'em here:<br /><a href="http://www.mikseri.net/artists/?id=18935">http://www.mikseri.net/vortech</a><br /><a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal</a>|2007-09-05 18:02|
42|torniojaws|Well, they're finally on tape!|I did the remaining vocals today and now I have vocals for all the required tracks. As you may have seen, I added a release date for Wasteland into the releases section, and the date is <b>September 26</b>. Mark it on your calendar, or something. Anyways, I heard from Kraken once more and if he manages to record some more vocals tomorrow, I'll include those. But it's no longer necessary for the album to be released, so there's no panic. While at it, I also added some small synth thingies to The Core to spice it up just a little.|2007-09-22 19:41|
43|torniojaws|And you know what that means!|I'm currently sitting here listening to the finished product for the first time in its entirety, just making sure there's nothing there that shouldn't be. Once I've confirmed it to be perfect, I'm going to start the release procedures. That means if all goes well, you'll hear this album within the next 3,5 hours :)<br /><br />Just like Conclusion, this album will be released in its entirety for free here at the website and select songs will be added (in fact, they already have been added) to some other media sites like Myspace, Mikseri.net and so on. Hang tight.|2007-09-23 17:38|

Vortech was also chosen as the Internet Find of the Week on the Finnish metal radio <a href="http://www.pommiradio.fi/index2.html">Pommiradio</a>.|2007-10-18 11:36|
46|torniojaws|Vortech on Pommiradio today|Tune to Pommiradio here: <a href="http://www.taajuus.fi/pl/pommiradio/b21855e5fe4773b31177c933f0759358.m3u">Pommiradio</a> . They will play some Vortech material within the next three hours (timezones below):<br /><br />9:00 to 12:00 UTC<br />12:00 - 15:00 GMT +3 (Helsinki)<br />5 AM to 8 AM EDT (New York)<br />6 PM to 9 PM (Tokyo).<br /><br />Update: They played Evolutionary Project and made a few comments about the style of the band.|2007-10-19 09:12|
47|torniojaws|Downloads offline for a while|The FTP service provider deleted all the files from Gavin's server because it apparently violates their terms of service, so until at earliest next wednesday (October 31) the files will be offline. I'll see if I can work something temporary out. Update: the main download link for the full album .zip works again, but the single-song links are still down.|2007-10-28 14:09|
48|torniojaws|New site online and downloads are back|Instead of having all songs available as single-file downloads, I just put a few select full songs per each release that you can download to get a picture of the music on that album. The full album .zip downloads are of course still available. I feel that this makes it a bit more simpler for counting downloads and you getting a better picture of the music.<br /><br />And of course the new website. Hope you enjoy it.|2007-11-03 09:50|
49|torniojaws|The next Vortech album|It's taking shape very well. Currently I have ten songs done and I'm still working on two more. The total length is about 50 minutes, but one song may drop depending on how I can re-do it, as I'm not yet satisfied with it. There may be one cover song, depending if I like the final product and if I get a permission for it. Once I've finished polishing up all the songs, it's time to start recording them.<br /><br />This time I will do the guitars a little bit different than usual. I'm planning to re-amp them in Relativity's rehearsal space house at some serious volume >:) and I think I'll make it two tracks of Marshall JCM900 SL-X 50W and two tracks of Engl Powerball 100W, both through my Engl Vintage 2x12" cab. Should sound sweet. Leads will probably be done with the Marshall.<br /><br />Overall the songs will be a lot more varied and progressive-ish than previously. A little slower too, except for two songs (no ballads though, heh). And decidedly more electronics all over. But don't worry, you'll still recognize the band in question ;)|2007-11-21 18:48|
50|torniojaws|Vortech in Miasma magazine|There's an interview/article on Vortech on the newest Miasma magazine (#21). I'm still waiting for mine to arrive so I can't describe what the final article is like. But we talked about the new album, the songwriting side and the equipment used while making Vortech albums. There was discussion about internet releases and such, too.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.miasma-mag.net/html/">http://www.miasma-mag.net</a>|2007-11-23 20:04|
51|torniojaws|Tracks for the next release|Well, here's a breakdown on the tracks of the next Vortech release. The titles aren't finished yet, they're just working titles. Also, the final tracklist will be different, this list is just alphabetical:<br /><br /><b>Bewildered Beyond Disknowledge </b>(3:33)<br />An older demo track remade, somewhat fast and traditional<br /><br /><b>Biodroid Legions </b>(4:32)<br />A fast one with a very heavy and dark chorus<br /><br /><b>Civil War (Funker Vogt cover)</b> (5:29)<br />This will maybe appear on the release, if I feel like it and I get a permission to use it. Compared to the original, this one's more concise and of course much heavier with guitars et al. Some artistic liberties taken too.<br /><br /><b>Deep Beneath </b>(6:28)<br />An ambient piece in Dark Corners of the Earth mood. Darkness and pressure.<br /><br /><b>Re-Activate</b> (3:28)<br />A bit darker song with some nice choirs, somewhat fast.<br /><br /><b>Retribution</b> (3:50)<br />Lots of strange melodies, midtempo with some blackish parts.<br /><br /><b>Rust</b> (3:14)<br />Fast one, quite grindy with a lush C-part<br /><br /><b>Shadow Shapes</b> (4:00)<br />The first song I did for this release, tricksy and melodic<br /><br /><b>The Six Phases of Unrest</b> (4:21)<br />Progressive and twisty, lots of varied parts.<br /><br /><b>The Undying Storm</b> (4:28)<br />Another proggy one with a driving chorus<br /><br /><b>Voidforms</b> (4:32)<br />More prog, this time a bit Arcturus-styled with strange leads and a dark fadeout|2007-12-02 09:26|
52|torniojaws|Wasteland downloads|The album Wasteland has now been downloaded 200 times in full since October 6 when I started counting. Also, there's almost 1000 unique listeners of Vortech over at <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Vortech">Last.fm</a>. Both are nice milestones to reach. Hopefully there will be a lot more downloads to come, too ;) In other news, I'm pretty much done with the next album's song order. Starting soon with the lyrics too.<br /><br />Update:<br />Looks like the download url to the Wasteland .zip file had been reverted to an older one with the redirect pointing to the previous ftp location, so the link didn't work. It's fixed now.|2007-12-15 18:07|
53|torniojaws|Albums of the Year 2007|Well, since the year is just about done I guess I'll list my personal Top 10 albums of 2007:<br /><br />#01: Ulver - Shadows of the Sun<br />#02: Elend - A World In Their Screams<br />#03: The Sin:Decay - Rehabilitation (EP)<br />#04: Samael - Solar Soul<br />#05: Rotting Christ - Theogonia<br />#06: Dream Theater - Systematic Chaos<br />#07: D𤨥imsgard - Supervillain Outcast<br />#08: Kaipa - Angling Feelings<br />#09: Grendel - Harsh Generation<br />#10: Ministry - The Last Sucker<br /><br />Update:<br />Oh and just in time for the new year, I upgraded the forum to phpBB 3.0.0 :) Should be much more bot-free now.|2007-12-30 12:17|
54|torniojaws|Small update to the site|I just finished tweaking some small things on pretty much every page of the site, plus I changed the Releases section completely. The Pictures section was changed too. If you see any strange things, or things which look odd, just refresh the site with Ctrl + F5 so it reloads everything from the server and doesn't use (old) cached files.<br /><br />Oh and I'm quite sure the next album will be called Deep Beneath. It depends on how the lyrics come together and whether it fits the title. However, the artwork I'm pretty set on. I'm still working on the front cover of the album, but here's the inner booklet and back artwork. Click on the images to open the DeviantArt pages of them, with a full-sized version. There's no text and such yet in the versions I posted, since someone might think the song titles are final. They aren't yet.<br /><br />Back:<br /><a href="http://torniojaws.deviantart.com/art/Biodroid-Legions-74023131"><img src="img/vortech-db-back.jpg" alt="Deep Beneath Back Art"/></a><br /><br />Inner booklet:<br /><a href="http://torniojaws.deviantart.com/art/Deep-Beneath-74023282"><img src="img/vortech-db-inner.jpg" alt="Deep Beneath Inner Art"/></a>|2008-01-06 15:03|
55|torniojaws|Future|Some people wonder how I can keep on putting out releases so fast. Here's how: I've already been fiddling around with two new tracks for the next album after the upcoming one :D Just received my new midi keyboard today, so now I can truly compose some nice midi stuff to the songs. The two songs so far seem to be a bit more keyboard oriented, so it might bring a nice change for the usual riffing.<br /><br />Oh and I also received my reamp box in the same shipment, so now I can also test around and see how it would work for some live playing. Kraken would also be the live lead guitarist (or bassist) and vocalist, if we ever do some live shows in the future. I would play rhythm guitar and handle the synths, electronics and such.<br /><br />Anyways, still continuing with the lyrics.|2008-01-08 18:37|
56|torniojaws|The List of Occurences|Well, I guess I'll just update this list to let you know how things progress. The tracklist and song titles aren't 100% final, there may be changes to both. But it's currently my choice between the various song orders I've tested:<br /><br />Progress status last updated 23 January 2008. All lyrics are finished, last tab starting.<br /><br />01. Re.Activate<br />- <span style="color: lime">Lyrics done</span><br />- <span style="color: lime">Guitar Pro tab done</span><br /><br />02.

Voidforms<br />- <span style="color: lime">Lyrics done</span><br />- <span style="color: lime">Guitar Pro tab done</span>|2008-01-14 21:08|
57|torniojaws|The next phase begins|Alright, I just finished tabbing the songs too, so now I have both lyrics and tabs for all the songs. That means that I'll begin recording DI guitars and bass soon, and that process will probably take a week or two. I've made preliminary arrangements with Kraken and he'll probably do vocals on a lot of the songs once again. Right now I'll go through the lyrics once more and decide the final titles for the songs.<br /><br />Here's the final tracklist and song titles:<br /><br />01. The Awakening <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br />02. Biodroid Legions <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br />03. The Undying Storm <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br />04. Shadow Shapes <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br />05. Retribution <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br />06. Bewildered <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br />07. Deep Beneath<br />08. Subjugation <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br />09. Exile Within <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br />10. So They Rise <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> &#124; <span style="color: lime">BDI</span><br /><br />Songs with a green <span style="color: lime">GDI</span> and <span style="color: lime">BDI</span> in them indicate that I've finished recording the final DI tracks for them; GDI = Guitar DI, BDI = Bass DI. <br /><br />If all goes well, the album should be out sometime March 2008. But if everything goes extremely well, it might be out a lot sooner.<br /><br />Here's a quick video of what's to come (from Biodroid Legions):<br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/bio.avi">http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/bio.avi</a><br /><br />Now that the guitars are done, it's bass time! I've also got a big bunch of videos from the DI guitar recording sessions, which I might compile a video of this weekend!|2008-01-23 12:24|
58|torniojaws|A week my ass...|I just finished recording all the bass tracks for all songs in one day :) So, now I have all the DI tracks for guitars and bass for all songs. Next up I'll do demo vocals for all the songs so that Kraken can learn how they go. Then he can start recording, or actually I can start recording since we can record the vocals over at the Relativity rehearsal space. Not this weekend since he doesn't have time to learn the songs and not next weekend since I'll be touring in Sweden with Relativity, but the next weekend (15 - 17 February) after that we should be able to start recording.|2008-01-31 19:18|
59|torniojaws|Vocal recording|The recording session has been postponed because Tero isn't in town next weekend, so I can't record them yet. So, February 22 - 24 is the new date. Meanwhile, I've finished a first instrumental test mix and it's sounding very nice. Very articulate and clear.|2008-02-10 20:48|
60|torniojaws|Future Plans|I've been going through some things and doing some research this week and the aim is to do a small pressing of all three full length Vortech albums: Conclusion (2006), Wasteland (2007) and Deep Beneath (2008). The print would 50 pcs of each album, and also 50 pcs of Vortech t-shirts. If all goes well, this will happen this summer, most likely in July or so, and you will be able to buy the CDs and the t-shirt (10xSmall, 20xMedium, 10xLarge, 10xExtra Large) through this website. From there on, if there is more demand for the CDs and t-shirts, I will order another pressing. But initially it will be a 50 pcs pressing of each.<br /><br />There may be another distributor too, but it depends on other issues. I will be able to ship them all around the world, but most likely the only payment method would be a bank transfer. If the other distributing system works out, there will also be credit card and PayPal options, but just for CDs.<br /><br />I haven't decided on the prices yet (it depends on how much the print will cost), but most likely they will be around 10 - 14 euros for a CD, and 15 - 20 euros for the t-shirts. But that is just an estimate.<br /><br />Stay tuned for more updates on the Deep Beneath recording process, which resumes next weekend with guitar reamping and vocal recording!|2008-02-15 19:04|
61|torniojaws|Today's the big day!|I just packed most of the stuff and I'm preparing to setup the reamping session over at Relativity rehearsal space. I'll try all sorts of things for the guitars and see what turns out the best. Once I'm happy with the guitar sound, I'll reamp all of them in one go and I'm also going to record some vocals too. That leaves just the guest vocalists' parts left to record and then I can start mixing the CD!|2008-02-22 14:49|
62|torniojaws|Reamping is done + more!|Alright, the session went beautifully after some initial fiddling. I've now got roughly 24 guitar tracks per song, dual miced with SM57 and into the Fireface 400. I also did vocals for the first two tracks so I can begin to do some initial vocal mixes of the songs. Right now I need some sleep after sitting in one place for 3 hours pushing space and clicking record :)<br /><br />I've got a whole bunch of pictures and videos from the session, which I will add to the "Making of" video for Deep Beneath. Also, as usual with the release of a new album, I've got a new website layout finished and I will post it as soon as finish writing out the last plain text tabulatures for the new songs. Maybe next week or so. It's also time to start recording Kraken's vocals soon, so hang tight!<br /><br />And here's a quick video clip from the session: <a href="http://user.personal.fi/musiikki/torniojaws/marsu-reamp.avi">marsu-reamp.avi</a>. Enjoy.|2008-02-22 21:44|
63|torniojaws|Website now updated + guitar info|As you hopefully see, I just updated the website layout for the upcoming album. As usual, if you see anything strange, try force refreshing with Ctrl + F5. There's a lot more stuff in the studio diary for the new album, so go check it out! I will add some pictures from the sessions later on.<br /><br />As for the guitars, I decided the scrub the reamped tracks and just go with impulses and EQ spectrums for the final tone. The reamped tracks sounded nice on their own and all, but they didn't fit very well into the mix, so it was a nice test but better left for some more practice. Anyways, this weekend and during next week, we'll be recording Kraken's vocals for the album over at the Siwa Studios. I already recorded two vocal tracks of my own last friday, but we'll see if I'll use them on the album.<br /><br />kthxbye.|2008-02-27 21:14|
64|torniojaws|Diary updated and lots of new pictures added!|Check out the diary for updated information from the sessions. Also check out the Photos section for 14 new pictures from the recordings at Siwa Studios. Tomorrow there will be more pictures from the vocal recording session with Kraken.|2008-02-28 21:06|
65|torniojaws|Vocal recording progress|The recording session has started up nicely today. We finished three songs, and I also did vocals for three songs which may be used in the final album. Tomorrow we'll try to record three more songs. Hopefully on monday we'll be able to finish the last three songs and then it's time to start mixing the new album!<br /><br />I took some pictures and videos, which I'll add later.<br /><br />Update:<br />There's now four additional pictures in the Photos section for Deep Beneath.|2008-03-01 18:21|
66|torniojaws|Vocal sessions, day 3|We just finished the third day of vocal recording and we managed to finish 3,5 songs. I did the vocals for one song in full and a nice black metal part in one song, which cracked us up very badly :) Very grim and frostbitten ;) So there is only 2,5 songs left to do, but they are quite difficult ones which means the progress is slow. Hopefully we can finish up them tomorrow. Then it's finally time to start mixing. Oh, and as usual there's a few videos and pictures, so hang tight for them.|2008-03-02 17:02|
67|torniojaws|It's a wrap!|All the vocals are now done! We just finished recording the last one, and you can expect some wild things in a few parts. Next up I'll start compiling the vocal tracks and add them to the song project files. I also need to finish the consolidation of all the guitar impulse tracks. Once those two things are done, I can start doing the final mix for all the songs. That should take a few days or so, so if all goes well I might even be able to release the album next week!<br /><br />There's some more pictures too: <a href="pics-deep.php">Photos</a>.|2008-03-03 14:30|
68|torniojaws|Mixing session|I'm currently mixing the songs for what I hope to be the final mix. I'll check out the mixes in a variety of setups and places and see if I like it. If I do like the mix, then it's time to release the album :) But we'll see. So far four songs have been fully mixed.|2008-03-06 08:55|
69|torniojaws|The new album has been released!|Today marks the release of Deep Beneath, the latest installment of the Vortech saga. Enjoy a dark release with heavy Lovecraftian undertones set in a futuristic world about to come to an end.<br /><br />There will be a 100 pcs CD print of the album this summer and maybe some t-shirts too, so hang tight for those if you prefer a hard copy :)<br /><br /><b>Deep Beneath (2008)</b><br /><img src="img/vortech-db420.jpg" alt="Deep Beneath class="dbkuva"/><br /><br />Download the FULL album here: <a href="http://www.vortechmusic.com/deepbeneath">vortech-deepbeneath.zip</a> (64 MB)<br /><br />01.

70|torniojaws|Downloads and Updates|Deep Beneath has now been downloaded almost 300 times! Thanks to everyone for interest! And as for the CD release of the three full length albums, things are progressing well. It is now quite certain that they will be available this summer and there will also be a Vortech t-shirt available. Depending on how well the shirt sells, there may also be a second type of t-shirt later on for diversity.<br /><br />During this time, I've been preparing all the background tracks for most of the songs from the three latest albums for possible live gigs this fall/winter. But first we need to rehearse the songs with Kraken during the summer and also see if it's feasible to perform with just two guys. If there's gigs, they will most likely be in this area (Tornio-Kemi-Oulu, maybe Rovaniemi) and perhaps in Sweden (Haparanda, Lule塡nd maybe Ume婮 I will also try to record those gigs and see how it works. Maybe put out a live album for fun, or just have them available for download. We'll see.<br /><br />I'll also start composing for the next Vortech album this summer, as usual, and aim for a release in the first quarter of 2009.

72|torniojaws|May update|Deep Beneath has been downloaded 430 times, and Wasteland is soon at 400! Things are progressing well so far, and I should have the CD prints of the three full length albums available in mid-June. They will be in super jewel box form with an 8-page booklet with all the lyrics and I'll see if there will be some additional artwork for the inner pages.<br /><br />I'll also start working on some new material around that time. I don't know how the material will turn out, but I have a feeling it will be quite fast with a lot more keyboards and synths now with a MIDI keyboard available.|2008-05-06 13:57|
73|torniojaws|CD news|I've finished with the material and have sent an order for the CDs to the factory. Unfortunately the super jewelbox was a bit too expensive, so I decided to go with the regular jewelbox instead. Anyways, there will be 100 pcs of both Wasteland and Deep Beneath available, and 50 pcs of Conclusion.<br /><br />And as a special bonus for CD orders, there are two bonus tracks on Deep Beneath (instrumental original demo versions of Biodroid Legions and Retribution), plus the making of... video for the album, which you can watch at Youtube too in lower quality.<br /><br />I will start taking orders once the CDs arrive, which shouldn't take too long anymore. If all goes well, they'll be available on Friday the 13th (oooh) of June. Each CD will cost 12 euros (18 USD) + shipping: 3 euros in Europe, 4 euros (6 USD) for the rest of the world. If you order more CDs, the shipping will be cheaper per CD.<br /><br />The t-shirts will be available later this month.<br /><br /><b>Update, 10 June 2008:</b><br />Looks like payments from outside the EU area would be problematic (expensive). I'll try looking into other options, so that fans living outside the EU area can also buy the albums. There's a distributor possibility, which would also make PayPal a possible payment method. The problem is that it would make the CDs a little bit more expensive, but if you order several CDs at once, after the shipping costs they will cost less.|2008-06-04 09:54|

75|torniojaws|Promotional material and updates|I'm sending promotional albums for select magazines and websites on Monday, so in a while there should be a lot of new reviews for Deep Beneath (13 places) and Wasteland (5 places). Also, I'm currently finishing up a brand new layout for the Vortech website. It will include some new material and sections, plus a few surprises! <br /><br /><img src="img/letters.jpg" alt="Promo albums" /><br /><br />And finally, as some of you may have noticed on Last.fm, I've got six songs demoed for the next Vortech album. This time I've been doing a mixture of speed and electronics, which should provide more listening pleasure ;) The working titles for the songs are: Afterworld, Humanity:Static, Posthumanism, The Wolves, Transcendence and Xenomorphosis.<br /><br />And lastly, Vortech albums are still available to buy worldwide from <a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?manufacturers_id=14076">TheGround.com</a> at a good price.

77|torniojaws|Reviews are starting to appear|The first one is the Finnish Imperiumi:<br /><br /><a href="http://imperiumi.net/alb_2.php?id=7980">http://imperiumi.net/alb_2.php?id=7980</a> - Wasteland, 7/10<br /><a href="http://imperiumi.net/alb_2.php?id=7984">http://imperiumi.net/alb_2.php?id=7984</a> - Deep Beneath, 7/10<br /><br />Not bad scores at all, since the same guy gave 8ݯ10 to Darkspace's III, which is one of the best albums of this year :) In short, the reviewer liked everything except the drum machine.<br /><br />I'll add more review links once they are published. There should be about half a dozen ones in English too, so hang tight!|2008-08-19 07:07|
78|torniojaws|Progress towards album #4|Well, I just finished two more demo songs, which brings the grand total to 8 finished demo songs clocking in at just under 35 minutes. I'll keep writing more songs until the end of October, or early November. Then I'll start going through the songs and picking which ones will be on the album and doing any changes needed to the other songs. After that I'll start working on the lyrics, which should be done around early December or so, hopefully. In January, it's once again time to start recording the final songs. The vocal recording sessions should be fun with mobile equipment now at my disposal.<br /><br />Here's some quick run-throughs of the songs so far, in alphabetical order with working titles for songs, the final names will be decided after the lyrics are done:<br /><br /><b>Afterworld</b> (3:54) [234 bpm]<br />Quite a fast song that starts out with a deceiving melody before lashing out. The first chorus is quite an evil sounding one, followed by a very old school Swedish death metal style main chorus.<br /><br /><b>Astral Breed</b> (3:58) [145 bpm]<br />A midtempo song with a mysterious main verse. The second part takes up the first space shuttle available. The chorus is a very sneaky one combining trance with a black metalish slower guitarline.<br /><br /><b>Bleak Expectations</b> (4:52) [220 bpm]<br />Starts out with some synth work, followed by some technical riffage with more black metal touches. The chorus is very melodic with lots of synth stuff and arpeggios. The C part contains black metal and more space-synths, with a nice solo spot later on.<br /><br /><b>Humanity: Static</b> (5:41) [156 bpm]<br />Very driving song all around, with lots of electronics and synths. A nice mystical and evil sounding chorus. Could be the album opener.<br /><br /><b>Posthumanism</b> (3:54) [256 bpm]<br />Extremely fast stuff, with a nice twisted melody-riddled chorus and lots of time signature changes. Very futuristic sound. Another candidate for an album opener.<br /><br /><b>The Wolves</b> (4:39) [157 bpm]<br />Starts out with an oriental style shredfest, followed by a futuristic setting going towards a very electronic chorus. Lots of heavy riffs.<br /><br /><b>Transcendence</b> (3:31) [157 bpm]<br />The first song composed after Deep Beneath. Nice and futuristic with a nice drive. The chorus may get a small change, but at the moment it's got a nice melody going on. The C-part features completely over the top drum machine work.<br /><br /><b>Xenomorphosis</b> (4:17) [244 bpm]<br />Fast stuff with a very futuristic feeling, fans of the original Need for Speed soundtrack will feel at home, especially during the chorus. Relentless song.<br /><br /><br />There you go for the time being!|2008-08-28 12:10|
79|torniojaws|New demo song now streaming|Go on to our Myspace page: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal</a> to listen to a brand new demo song in full! The song is instrumental at the moment, but there will be vocals on the album version.<br /><br />Oh and I've decided to take up on describing the genre of Vortech as Cybertech, since it gets a bit old saying "Industrial black/death progressive metal" :) That name should concisely tell what the music is all about.|2008-08-28 13:13|
80|torniojaws|Another review + more|<a href="http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=6&id=14879">http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=6&id=14879</a><br /><br />There's another decent review. There's more to come still, and reviews should be appearing in some magazines too, so hopefully there'll be more and more exposure :)<br /><br /><b>Update, 4 September:</b><br />Another review has been published, over at Stalker Music (in Finnish):<br /><a href="http://www.stalkermusic.com/index.shtml?call=review&id=324">http://www.stalkermusic.com/index.shtml?call=review&id=324</a><br /><br />A very nice review mostly, with only some minor nitpicks here and there about the music. Apparently the Wasteland review is coming soon too.|2008-09-03 07:14|
81|torniojaws|It's a live one, soon|Alright, the preparations are soon nearing an end. I've finished almost all the backing tracks (drums, electronics, etc). All live drums use the same Superior Drummer 2.0 kit, so that there's the same drum sound for all songs from each album. And at that, I also re-composed a lot of the drumming from Conclusion and Wasteland. The drums still play mostly the same base beats, but with different fills and such, and sometimes different beats altogether. A lot of the songs have new synths added too, and in a few cases there's all new synth work in the songs that didn't have any on the album (Their Contract and Winds of Contamination, most prominently). So, you'll hear much new stuff in the live renditions of the songs :)<br /><br />I still need to finish a few more songs, though, but it shouldn't take long. The next step is rehearsing all the songs with Matti, and hopefully we can start the rehearsals this weekend. Once we can nail most of the songs, we can start looking for gigs :)|2008-09-15 06:48|
82|torniojaws|You asked for it, you got it!|You can now buy all three Vortech albums as FLAC files from TheGround.com. Each album costs 3,99 euros and here's the direct links:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?products_id=4226&language=en">Deep Beneath</a><br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?products_id=4227&language=en">Wasteland</a><br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?products_id=4228&language=en">Conclusion</a><br /><br />The same payment options (PayPal, Visa, Visa Electron, MasterCard, etc) are available as before.<br /><br />The artwork for the albums can be <a href="artwork.php">downloaded here</a><br /><br />Enjoy!|2008-09-18 08:53|
83|torniojaws|Progress|Some small news to tell. Firstly, I have completed all the necessary tracks etc for Vortech rehearsals and live shows, so now we can begin rehearsing. At the same time, I went through the unfinished Deep Beneath text tabulatures, and all of them are now finished too. You can see them in the <a href="tabs.php">Tabs</a> section.|2008-09-27 14:51|
84|torniojaws|Dry rehearsing and guestbook update|Well, I started dry rehearsing at home today and after a few completions, it's starting to feel real good with the songs. Except for a few extreme jumps from rhythm to lead guitar, everything goes nice and smoothly. I won't reveal the song list, because that would ruin the fun :) But I can tell that there's 1 song from Conclusion, 4 songs from Wasteland and 4 songs from Deep Beneath, and the total duration is somewhere around 40 minutes in all. We will begin rehearsing next weekend and hopefully we'll make it in time to do some gigs this year.<br /><br />And regarding the guestbook. I'm not sure if there was some bug in it, making some messages appear empty, but I just re-wrote it from scratch and now it definitely should function without problems (plus a bit more streamlined). So, if your messages have disappeared, try it now.|2008-09-28 21:03|
85|torniojaws|Reverb Nation|I just opened up an accout for Vortech at Reverb Nation. I added a new instrumental demo song available there, called Posthumanism. Go check it out:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/vortech">http://www.reverbnation.com/vortech</a><br /><br />Update:<br /><strike>Heh, except that their servers crashed?</strike> Seems to be back online.|2008-09-29 09:41|
86|torniojaws|Album prices|I just wanted to remind those of you who use the US dollar that since the dollar has been strengthening recently against the Euro, the relative prices of our albums have dropped. Each CD costs 16.20 USD, and all full FLAC album downloads cost 5.39 USD.<br /><br />You can get them from the usual place, on TheGround.com:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?products_id=4226&language=en">Deep Beneath</a> (CD/FLAC/MP3)<br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?products_id=4227&language=en">Wasteland</a> (CD/FLAC/MP3)<br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?products_id=4228&language=en">Conclusion</a> (CD/FLAC/MP3)|2008-10-10 04:34|
87|torniojaws|Strange review|Well, here's certainly a strange review of Deep Beneath:<br /><a href="http://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=6873">http://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=6873</a>. The reviewer basically quotes half of the covering letter and then tells you that he really doesn't know anything about this genre of music :) Ah well, maybe it's a different angle then. The strangest part is that the same site just had Psycroptic, Gojira and Vader reviews...<br /><br />Oh and in other news, I've recently done a few more demo songs (Bleak Existence & Shedding the New Flesh) for the next album, plus started to work on a fully electronic song too. I'll see what will come of it, but it should be interesting nevertheless.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Woops, make that three new demo songs :) Just finished a song called Synthetic Life, with lots of melodies and tricky rhythm guitars.|2008-10-10 18:35|
88|torniojaws|Review on new Sue magazine|You can read it in Finnish here (pages 32 - 33):<br /><a href="http://www.sanomapaino.fi/nakoislehti/rsue/index.html">http://www.sanomapaino.fi/nakoislehti/rsue/index.html</a><br /><br />And I've recently started working on the next website layout :) And as for demos, there's now 10 complete demo songs clocking in at a little over 42 minutes, but I'll keep on making more songs until the end of the year. Then I'll start going through the arrangements, songs and so on to finish them up and decide which songs will be on the album. Lyrics will most likely be done around late December to February, and then I'll start recording.|2008-10-16 09:24|
89|torniojaws|First rehearsals|Alright, today we finally had our first rehearsals with the band. After some fumbling we started to get somewhere, and with a little bit more rehearsing we'll be in good shape for some live shows. We'll rehearse twice more this weekend, and here's a full song from our rehearsals today. Have fun with Their Contract:<br /><br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech-contract_rehearsal.mp3">vortech-contract_rehearsal.mp3</a>|2008-10-24 19:47|

91|torniojaws|Downloads offline|The FTP server I use for the downloads has been taken down until 15 November for a big update, so you can't download any music until then. I'll try to find another server if possible.

The site will be fully at the <a href="http://www.vortechmusic.com">http://www.vortechmusic.com</a> domain, ie. if you go to the releases page, it will be at <a href="http://www.vortechmusic.com/releases.php">http://www.vortechmusic.com/releases.php</a> and not http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech/releases.php anymore.|2008-11-16 15:14|
93|torniojaws|Important news!|The distributor that I used to sell Vortech CDs is ending business at the end of this year, and because of that I've made some very special price changes for Vortech albums (CD, mp3 and FLAC) at the site. If you wish to buy the albums and support us, now's your chance to get the albums at the following prices:<br /><br />CD - 7,99 EUR (10 USD)<br />Full mp3 album - 1,99 EUR (2.5 USD)<br />Full FLAC album - 1,99 EUR (2.5 USD)<br /><br />So, be quick and order while there's still stock available (not many left!).<br /><br />North America / Worldwide:<br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?manufacturers_id=14076&language=en">http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?manufacturers_id=14076&language=en</a><br /><br />European Union countries:<br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?manufacturers_id=14076&language=en">http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?manufacturers_id=14076&language=en</a><br /><br />Suomi:<br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?manufacturers_id=14076">http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?manufacturers_id=14076</a><br /><br /><b>Update 24 November</b><br />Well, looks like they aren't quitting completely, they'll just stop selling CDs. They'll still keep the mp3 and FLAC stores open. I'll keep the discount prices until mid-December, when they stop shipping CDs.<br /><br />The new website is almost finished, should be online by the end of this week.|2008-11-19 19:06|
94|torniojaws|Some updates|There's a bit of a hassle at the domain side of things, so you can't see the new site yet, but it is done. I'll upload it in a few hours, but the domain won't probably be fixed until tomorrow.<br /><br />And in other news, I think I'm done writing songs for the next album. There's 11 finished songs at 48:20 and two incomplete ones that I need to arrange + one extra electronic/industrial one that may also be our intro tape at live shows. So it should be interesting. The songs are quite a bit faster and more melodic compared to Deep Beneath, and I think the vocals will also have more variety, since Matti has been learning some new stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, I think I'll start recording the songs near the end of this year and then start working on the lyrics as usual. Then it's time to record the vocals, probably in February or March 2009, and from there on it takes some time to finish the mix and then do a CD print.<br /><br />See ya.|2008-11-30 14:20|
95|torniojaws|Here we are!|Finally the site is back! And as you can probably see, with a brand new disguise. Anyway, I finished up one of the incomplete songs (The Wolves) by adding a completely new kickass evil chorus and a nice, fast-paced second riff. Now the song definitely kicks ass, should be a fun live song. So that leaves just two songs to splice and dice, and then the album will be ready for recording! Maybe even before giftmas...|2008-12-01 23:30|
96|torniojaws|Preproduction almost finished|Alright, I've finally chosen which songs to include on the album and now it is time to go through their project files and finalize the songs, especially the drum programming. There's 11 songs in total, clocking in at about 48 minutes in length. The premise (and sound) is quite futuristic, but I need to finish the lyrics before I can tell more about the story.<br /><br />This baby is a lot faster than Deep Beneath, and colder in that Demanufacture or Tonight's Decision way. The sound is more space-y with often multilayered melodies. We'll see what comes to be when the vocal arrangements are done...|2008-12-09 20:36|
97|torniojaws|No more CDs from The Ground|Okay, just to inform you that The Ground is no longer selling CDs. From now on you can only get digital music at their store. And for some reason FLAC has stopped working there.<br /><br />In other news, I'll start recording the final tracks for the next album sometime next week.|2008-12-17 19:42|
98|torniojaws|End of the Year|Well, I'm now setting up the final recording project files for each song and I'm ready to start recording the guitars and bass for the next album. Shouldn't take too long anymore. The final tracklist is also forming up, with only some minor changes in a few places.<br /><br />And as usual, here's my Top 10 albums for the year. If you haven't heard these, give 'em a listen. Really nice stuff, at least for me:<br /><br />01. Opeth - Watershed<br />02. Darkspace - Dark Space III<br />03. The Amenta - n0n<br />04. Amon Amarth - Twilight of the Thunder God<br />05. Scar Symmetry - Holographic Universe<br />06. Gojira - The Way of All Flesh<br />07. Arcana - Raspail<br />08. Black Comedy - Instigator<br />09. Misery Index - Traitors<br />10. Qntal - Translucida<br /><br />And as for gigs, I've got a few threads running and we'll see how they work out. There's also going to be a gig at a festival in Liminka, and they're threatening to make us the headliner ;) Should be fun then.<br /><br />Have a nice year now.|2008-12-30 17:51|
99|torniojaws|Starting the new year off|I just uploaded a third new instrumental demo song to Myspace. The song has the working title Xenomorphosis. Enjoy: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal</a><br /><br />Oh yeah, and everything's ready to start recording the final guitars and bass for the next album! I'll start the sessions tomorrow, and I'll do some updates as I go. This will take about a week or so, since I also tab out (text and Guitar Pro) the songs at the same time. Once the instrument tracks are finished, I'll start working on the lyrics.|2009-01-05 11:57|

101|torniojaws|All guitars and bass tracks are now on tape!|I just finished recording all the bass tracks for the 11 songs in about 3,5 hours including a dinner break :D Not too shabby. Okay, now that all the instruments are on tape, I can start working on the lyrics over the next month or so. I'll try some different things this time and maybe Matti will do some lyrics too. I'll post some pictures and videos from the session some time later too. Gotta go through them first and make a nice compilation.|2009-01-18 16:52|
102|torniojaws|Pictures added, videos to come|You may have noticed that I added pictures to both <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">Myspace</a> and the <a href="?page=pictures">Pictures</a> section on this site. I will post a rough video compilation later on, but it will probably take a while. Nothing more to report at this point, but we'll most likely have a rehearsal session this weekend with Matti. Maybe this time we'll have a bit more clips to post.|2009-01-20 19:14|
103|torniojaws|Rehearsal weekend|This weekend was spent in the rehearsal space and things went pretty well. We played through the set a few times and also recorded the second session. It's not very good quality (a single condenser mic in the middle of the room), so I don't think it's going to be released anywhere.<br /><br />In the gig front, I've been asking around and so far at least one gig is fairly sure, and another will most likely happen too. More news will come when things move forward.|2009-02-01 11:45|
104|torniojaws|Lyrics progress|Okay, I'll add another progress tracker for your viewing pleasure. I'm taking my time with the lyrics instead of rushing through them, so the progress can be slow.<br /><br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Afterworld<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Bleak Expectations<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Humanity: Static<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Mastermind<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Posthumanism<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Shedding the New Flesh<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Synthetic Life<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - The New Creations<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - The Wolves<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Transcendence<br /><span class="g">LYRICS</span> - Xenomorphosis<br /><br />And once again, the titles are still the working titles. Once all the lyrics are done, I'll post the final names.<br /><br />kthxbye|2009-02-02 20:20|
105|torniojaws|First 2009 studio session video online|Keep your ears peeled for some quick snippets of other new songs.

106|torniojaws|Gig in Oulu confirmed|We have a gig in Oulu, at Club Lupi on 12 June 2009. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fatalsoundproject">Fatal Sound Project</a> will also play that evening. I've been asking around for more gigs, so hopefully there will be more this year.|2009-02-20 15:23|
107|torniojaws|Vocal Sessions, Day 1|I'm just back from the rehearsal space, where we finished the vocals for two tracks. We'll continue tomorrow with more time and hopefully we'll be able to finish three more tracks. I took some pictures and video clips, and I'll post them sometime soon. I'll also start doing some initial mix tests for the next album. Things are going well so far.|2009-03-01 17:50|
108|torniojaws|Vocal Sessions, Day 2|Three? Pfft... We finished five songs and that leaves just 4 songs to record in the next session in mid-March. And once again there's some new video material and some pictures. During the break, I'll finish the lyrics for the songs that don't have full lyrics yet.|2009-03-02 18:06|
109|torniojaws|All lyrics finished|Now that all the lyrics are done, it's time to wait for the next vocal recording session in mid-March, but meanwhile I'll finish the album artwork and look for more gigs (another gig for 2009 is certain, but dates etc are not yet confirmed). And as promised, here are the final song titles, the album song list and durations:<br /><br />01. Posthumanism (3:25)<br />02. Xenomorphosis (4:16)<br />03. Destined to Fall (4:08)<br />04. Humanity: Static (5:42)<br />05. The Wolves (4:24)<br />06. The New Creations (4:33)<br />07. Lifeline (4:52)<br />08. Afterworld (3:45)<br />09. False Salvation (5:21)<br />10. Transcendence (3:59)<br />11. Shedding the Flesh (2:59)<br /><br />Total: 47:26<br /><br />And the album title is Posthumanism.<br /><br />See ya!|2009-03-06 10:20|
110|torniojaws|Front cover, version 1|Here's the first version of the front cover. Maybe it will change, maybe it won't. I'll see later, but meanwhile...<br /><br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/post800.jpg"><img src="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/post400.jpg"></a><br /><br />Click for bigger version.|2009-03-08 13:32|
111|torniojaws|A new song is available!|I just uploaded a slightly edited version (no interlude ambience in the beginning) of Destined to Fall to Myspace. Go check it out! It's a bit slower song compared to the usual...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal</a><br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Vote for the song in the Radio Rock thingy (select a score below the player) /<br />Arvostele ko. biisi Radio Rockin jutussa:<br /><a href="http://www.radiorock.fi/biisiarvostelut/arvostele.asp?id=726">http://www.radiorock.fi/biisiarvostelut/arvostele.asp?id=726</a>|2009-03-13 10:14|
112|torniojaws|Delay for vocals|Unfortunately there's been a delay for the vocal recording sessions, and they will resume in mid-April. Meanwhile, I'll finish the final mix for the album for the other songs, so the album should still be out in April, if all goes well.|2009-03-21 10:48|
113|torniojaws|Some server errors|<strike>It seems that MBNet is having some sort of problems with their server, so the promo/studio pictures, album artwork images, and the download for Deep Beneath aren't working right now. Hopefully they'll fix it soon.</strike><br /><br />Everything's back to normal.|2009-03-27 14:41|
114|torniojaws|Almost there!|I just finished mixing all the songs for the next album! Now all I need are those remaining 4 vocal tracks and then I can release it. Let's all cheer for Kraku to finish them ;)|2009-03-30 18:11|
115|torniojaws|Fan page in Facebook|A fan has created a fan page for Vortech at this address: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vortech/62402154130?ref=ts">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vortech/62402154130?ref=ts</a>. Go check it out! Thanks David :)<br /><br />And I've been listening to the rough full album (otherwise ready, except the 4 tracks without vocals) and it's sounding very good indeed. I'm very happy how it turned out :)|2009-04-02 18:30|
116|torniojaws|Final vocal session|Alright, the date has been set to 15 April, and we intend to record all 4 songs in 1-3 days. Provided there's no problems during recording, I can release the album the same day! At first, the album will be available as a free mp3 download and voluntary paid version (1,99 EUR, mostly for supporting our work if you feel like it), and later on a CD print will be made.<br /><br />I've also been asked about Vortech shirts. It depends on how well the new album fares: the more interest there is, the faster I can have the shirts available ;) I hope to have shirts for sale by 12 June, when we have a gig in Oulu.<br /><br />And finally, I'll start working on some more making of videos for the new album soon. So stay tuned for some updates, maybe even this evening!|2009-04-06 13:25|
117|torniojaws|Don't look into the mouth of a gift horse..|There's one final new addition at Myspace before the album release. The entire song Transcendence as an instrumental version. Have fun...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal</a>|2009-04-07 18:14|
118|torniojaws|Second vocal session!|Alrighty, we resumed recording today and we managed to finish 2 more songs fully! That leaves just two songs for tomorrow and then we should be all done! Hopefully there will be something special on release day, but we'll see...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and there's been a small switch with vocal mics, since Mikko (Relativity) managed to somehow break Tero's SM57 (!) after the first recording sessions. It's a very sexy T.Bone CD 55 :D Doesn't sound too bad, though. Almost 1:1 with the 57.|2009-04-14 17:42|
119|torniojaws|Are you ready?|Are you ready?<br /><br />Preparations underway, images are offline for a few minutes...|2009-04-15 22:19|
120|torniojaws|Posthumanism, &#1087;&#1086;&#1078;&#1072;&#1083;&#1091;&#1081;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072;!|Download it while it's hot!

121|torniojaws|Posthumanism at The Ground|If you wish to support our work at this point, you can buy the mp3 album from here for 1,99 EUR:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?products_id=29176&language=en">http://www.theground.com/catalog/artist.php?products_id=29176&language=en</a><br /><br />The CD version will be available later on.|2009-04-19 08:17|
122|torniojaws|Reaching the limits|Alright, looks like there was so much demand for the older albums (too) that we've almost reached the monthly transfer limits and I'm not sure what the provider does when you exceed it: either they close the site for the month, or it will become very slow. So if the site closes (there's only about 20 MB left, so it probably happens soon), check out our <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">Myspace</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Vortech">Last.fm</a> pages while waiting for the site to return!<br /><br />Oh and Posthumanism has been downloaded 350 times in 5 days!|2009-04-21 06:00|
123|torniojaws|Live updates|Well, for the arranger's personal reasons the Liminka gig will probably not happen, and Fatal Sound Project had to cancel the 12 June gig in Oulu due to double-booking. We'll still play there, but the second band will be selected later.<br /><br />Oh and slightly related, I will be doing a solo cover gig at a school May Day afterparty, playing an hour's worth of party music. There will be songs from Pain, Clawfinger, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie and so on :) If you're around in Kemi, come see the show! The venue is still unclear, but I'll update once I know it.<br /><br />Update:<br />The venue is Hullu Pohjola and the show starts at around 23:59 on 30 April.<br /><br />Update #2:<br />Okay, due to a small miscommunication, there will be an ad for the show stating that Vortech will play there. It's not Vortech and there won't be Vortech songs (unless the audience really wants to hear some more :P). The official name of the one-off show band is Boylestad Slam (inside humour).|2009-04-24 19:20|
124|torniojaws|Planning the next release|Okay, now that the album has been out for a while, it's time to look forward towards the next release! I've been meaning to do something a bit different for a while, and I think now is the moment for it. The next one will be a 5 or 6 song EP with a very very wild musical style which I won't reveal quite yet, but let's say it's something that not many people (if any!) have done before :) If it works out, who knows - maybe the next full length will also continue in that style...|2009-05-13 10:40|
125|torniojaws|Loads of downloads!|Posthumanism has been downloaded 518 times now, and Deep Beneath recently reached 1014 downloads! Nice milestones to reach, thank you :) Be prepared for the first Vortech live performance in years on 12 June at Oulu! The setlist will contain 5 songs from Posthumanism, 2 songs from Deep Beneath and 3 songs from Wasteland. See you there!<br /><br />Oh and remember to tune to The Pit of the Damned web radio on 18 May at 21-22:30 (C.E.T.) to hear Vortech and others! The address is <a href="http://www.yastaradio.com">http://www.yastaradio.com</a>. The show will also be re-broadcast on 20 May (19-20:30 [C.E.T.]) and 22 May (04-05:30 [C.E.T.])!|2009-05-16 18:16|
126|torniojaws|Gig update|Two new bands have been added to the Oulu gig on 12 June:<br /><a href="http://www.catamenia.net">Catamenia</a><br /><a href="http://www.katyri.com">K嵹ri</a><br /><br />We are most likely playing as the second band, see you there! Oh and we'll also bring CDs for sale, at a nice price of all three CDs (Conclusion, Wasteland and Deep Beneath) for 30 euros in total! But if things go well, there might be something more...|2009-05-22 14:18|
127|torniojaws|Shop opened!|Alrighty! Once again people from outside the EU have a chance to buy our albums. The shop uses PayPal, so anyone that wishes to use it instead is of course able to do so. Enjoy the new system and stay tuned for some new products available this summer, including a CD version of Posthumanism! Exclamation mark!<br /><br />PS.<br />Don't miss out on the shop opening offer with all 3 full length CDs in one 30 EUR package including shipping!|2009-05-31 09:29|
128|torniojaws|Another gig confirmed!|I just received confirmation for our appearance at Liminka on 4 July! No idea what other bands will play there, but come see it anyway! Meanwhile, we're doing some final preparations for our gig in Oulu next week. See you there!|2009-06-02 18:55|
129|torniojaws|Gig tonight|Okay, tonight's the big night! After 8 years of not playing live with Vortech, it's once again time to play a gig. We'll play 10 songs and for about 45 minutes, so you'll get a nice fill. The first band starts at 23:00 and we'll start at around midnight. There's also CDs for sale at the show, for 10 euros per album. See you there!|2009-06-12 06:46|
130|torniojaws|Postconcertism|The gig went quite nicely and we had fun, thanks for everyone! I'll post the details soon to the live section. Now it's time to prepare for the next gig on 4 July at Liminka.|2009-06-13 11:16|
131|torniojaws|Liminka unsure|It looks like the organizer is having some financial issues, so the gig may or may not happen. I'll post more information once I get some news from them.|2009-06-16 17:40|
132|torniojaws|Liminka Cancelled|Unfortunately the organizers have cancelled the event, so naturally we will not be playing at Liminka either. Hopefully we'll play there some other day, as it seems that they're still trying to make the show happen at a later date.<br /><br />In other news, I'm soon going to start composing material for the next release. I'll see how the composing progresses.  There may be two different releases at the same time depending on a few things.|2009-06-27 18:46|
133|torniojaws|Pictures from the Oulu gig!|Check them out at Facebook:<br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=52394711377&view=all">http://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=52394711377&view=all</a>|2009-07-09 14:15|
134|torniojaws|Gig (reprise)|Okay, it seems like there will be a gig on 22 August, but more info later... Let's hope it won't suffer the same fate :) Our setlist will be a bit different compared to the previous gig. But come see the show and hear ;)<br /><br />Update:<br />The location is Liminka.|2009-07-23 09:44|
135|torniojaws|Okkult Tupos Attakk: Liminkvlt|Okay, the festival is pretty certain now. We will be playing there, along with:<br /><br />Forensic Hardcore<br />Northern Discomfort<br />Running Amok<br />Silent Threnody<br />Unit 731<br />Ŭymyst򼢲 /><br />The location is the Nuorisoseura at Liminka (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/pa84ew">Krankantie 1</a>), and the tickets will be 5 EUR. The day is 22 August (saturday). See you there!|2009-08-11 17:48|
136|torniojaws|T-shirt competition!|I'm going to do a t-shirt print for Vortech and I'd like to know which design everyone would like. So, select one of four designs at Facebook and post a comment. I will select one random person from the voters and s/he will get one shirt (any size) for free! Time to vote! ;)<br /><br /><a href="http://tinyurl.com/msjehv">http://tinyurl.com/msjehv</a> (at Facebook, where must be logged in).<br /><br />The competition runs until 31 August 2009, or until there's at least 10 votes!<br /><br />Update:<br />The poll is now available in Myspace too!<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&blogId=506116408">Myspace Blog</a>|2009-08-14 12:19|
137|torniojaws|Vortech on Youtube|I've started to upload all the Vortech releases to Youtube, where you can access them through the official Vortech channel at the following address:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/VortechBand">http://www.youtube.com/user/VortechBand</a><br /><br />Enjoy the music, and remember to listen in HQ!|2009-08-18 16:29|
138|torniojaws|Back from Liminka|What an excellent event! Everything worked so well and the audience liked the music. That's all you need for a good show! Now it's time to concentrate fully onto songwriting, and preparing for the next Vortech album! This time it will probably take slightly longer, and perhaps the album will be released late summer, or early fall in 2010, but that's just a guesstimate. Maybe it will be ready sooner, or later?|2009-08-23 12:14|
139|torniojaws|Updates|Okay, there's now some pictures from the Liminka gig at our Facebook page: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=661579&l=8f7f485e7b&id=1318820676">Vortech @ Nuorisoseura, Liminka, Finland, 2009-08-22</a><br /><br />Thanks to Masa for the pictures! More pictures are coming later on...<br /><br />And that brings another point. I'm slowly starting to create the next version of the Vortech website, and this time the picture gallery system will be more functional from the admin-side, and should allow pictures to be added faster for everyone's viewing pleasure! (and 25 other updates, but that's later on).|2009-08-23 20:01|
140|torniojaws|Songwriting|The process is advancing at a steady pace. So far there's one complete song, another almost ready and two more being worked on. The material seems to be slightly more electronic in vibe, but also quite fast.<br /><br />In other news, Posthumanism has now been downloaded over 1000 times! And Wasteland is only a few downloads away from the same amount! Thank you for that, hope you'll also enjoy the next album as much :)|2009-08-31 14:37|
141|torniojaws|T-Shirt Contest Finished!|The results are in and the winner is.... Marko R.! Congratulations!<br /><br />And the design that received the most votes (40 % of votes) was design number 3, or this one:<br /><br /><img src="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/tpaita2009.png" alt="Winning T-Shirt"/><br /><br />The shirt will be ordered early next week and will probably arrive from printing around mid-September.

143|torniojaws|Showtime!|There might be a show coming up around mid-October in Oulu! More information coming up later. Oh and the songwriting process is still going on, right now there's four full demo songs, one almost finished demo song, and 2-3 partial songs being worked on! Looks like the songs are kinda new style, some parts much harder black metal and some parts much more electro-industrial. We'll see what comes out in the end :D|2009-09-28 16:23|
144|torniojaws|One more gig|A new gig is confirmed for Thursday 3 December in Raahe at the Rytmikellari! Free entrance! We will also have some shirts and CDs for sale, as usual. Come and taste the band!|2009-09-30 14:24|
145|torniojaws|Questionmark|Well, it seems the Oulu gig on 15 October still isn't certain. It seems the arrangers are not sure about the show, so don't hold your horses for the show to happen. We hope it does, but it seems fairly unlikely.|2009-10-06 15:03|
146|torniojaws|No gig next week|Yeah, still no word from the arrangers and we set the deadline to this day. So, it leaves more time to prepare for the Raahe gig in December! There are some cool plans, but more on that later on.<br /><br />Still working on the new songs, and the newest piece is a really slow apocalyptic vision of doom (ooh, where did I hear that?). It sounds really cool and different :) It may become the album closing song. And as I keep on listening to the 5 fully finished tracks, they feel more and more kickass! Can't wait to release the next album :) But there's still lots of work left before that...|2009-10-11 20:15|
147|torniojaws|Gig in Oulu!|There's a new show added for 4 November (wednesday) at Yk宠Pub in Oulu! Joining us will be D򲴥rror from Gothenburg, Sweden and Magpie from Oulu. See you there!|2009-10-23 14:00|
148|torniojaws|Another new song|Just finished the newest piece, 262 bpm of all-out black metalish shredding ;) It's a ridiculous song, and should be fun to play live :D|2009-10-31 00:26|
149|torniojaws|Gig in 21 hours from now!|Okay it's once again gig time! We have some merchandise with us too, at very special show prices:<br /><br />T-shirt = 10 euros<br />T-shirt + 2 CDs = 25 euros<br />T-shirt + 3 CDs = 30 euros!<br /><br />See you at Yk宠Pub on wednesday 4 November at 21:30!|2009-11-03 22:17|
150|torniojaws|Preparing for the Raahe gig|Okay, the idea is that we will record the gig for a live album of sorts! It will of course be released through the website, and maybe on CD later on. But there are still some questions about it, and the biggest one is that there's probably no FOH at the show :D I'll have to do it myself... while playing on stage :P So, hopefully it works out well enough.|2009-11-05 23:38|
151|torniojaws|Website back!|Our webhost screwed up the domain update and that's why you saw the ad page for a while. Now the site seems to be back up, so have fun!<br /><br />I'm currently working on a thrashier song, let's see what happens with it.<br /><br />I also finished one previously started song, called Charcoal Earth. Melancholic, electronic and fast :P There's now 8 finished songs and 33 minutes of material for the next album. I'm yet to make some ambient songs, so let's see.|2009-11-17 06:26|
152|torniojaws|Progress towards album #5|Just like I did one for the past couple of albums, here's a quick run through the so far completed demo tracks, how they sound etc. Again, the song titles may not be final, as they will be named after the lyrics have been finished. Okay, let's see. These are in alphabetical order:<br /><br /><b>Chaos Dimension</b><br />A bit slower (in Vortech scale :D) with lots of melody and synths, but the chorus goes down a dark path towards (you guessed it!), chaos feel in the first two appearances of the chorus, with a nice lead line replacing the grand piano in the remaining choruses. Imagine opening a door and stepping out to a thunderstorm.<br /><br /><b>Charcoal Earth</b><br />The quick intro leads you right into a melodic black metal kind of chorus, followed by a melancholic verse part where the synths take the stage. Soon the mood goes towards darkness... I think the verse has a lot of Need for Speed II/III intro music feel. A bit more experimental in the later parts of the song. Overall somewhat lush, but uneasy in mood.<br /><br /><b>Demon In the Circuitry</b><br />The first song written for the upcoming album. Starts with some tentative blasting, leading into a mysterious verse. The chorus lets it loose, leading back to a Millennium era FLA-like dark thingy. On the second time, the chorus gets a nice lead addition, much in Deep Beneath spirit. Then it's time to stop and hammer down an intense breakdown with lots of processed synth.<br /><br /><b>Frozen Machine</b><br />The most extreme song I've done for Vortech. All out black metal at 262 bpm with lots of mountain-high orchestral synths, ridiculous shredding rhythms and a desperate lead guitar line. And back to some more fireworks and leads. And some more muscular blasting :P A brief slow part, picking up the pace in no time, leading into the snowstorm of a chorus. Think of Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, taking place in the future...<br /><br /><b>Neurovirus</b><br />The future is grim indeed, in a bit more thrash-like song, with a nice twist. Fear Factory goes Meshuggah? A bit eastern in the chorus, followed by a melodic post-chorus. Then it's blast-time, and back to some tricksy palm mutes.<br /><br /><b>Pyre of Souls</b><br />Now this is an interesting piece. And yes, this song was written before Devin released Addicted! :) An upbeat, very industrial metal song in pure mid-90's Waltari style, but with some twisted melodies. This song is actually compiled of some excellent outtake riffs from the Posthumanism sessions, that didn't fit into the other songs, but sounded great on their own. Get your ass shakin' :D<br /><br /><b>The Apocalypse</b><br />What else would a song with a title like that be? Blastbeat and shr... well, actually it's a doom metal song :D From 262 bpm down to 80 bpm! Very slow and haunting, with more synths than your average doom song, but that's what experimentation is about ;) Think of H.P. Lovecraft in song form. Very eerie, mysterious and dark. Quite a different style than the other songs, and it's possibly the album ending song.<br /><br /><b>The Black Rite</b><br />A monster of a chorus! Very epic and grand, plus heavy of course. Somewhat more in the progressive vein of Deep Beneath, but with more synths and devilish melodies. One of my favourite songs of these eight, and will end up in our live set for sure. It already sounds like an excellent song to end a show with!<br /><br /><br />So there you go, a quick description of the songs finished so far. I will keep writing songs until new year or so, including some ambient stuff again, and there's also a few unfinished songs left to complete. Overall, I think there will be 15 songs from which I will select the final 10-11 songs for the album. Should be a nice continuation to the Vortech timeline! No idea of when it will be finished, but more than likely it will be spring 2010 or so, as usual ;)|2009-11-18 17:17|
153|torniojaws|New song available!|I just posted the instrumental demo version of Frozen Machine to our Myspace page at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal</a><br /><br />Enjoy ;)|2009-11-19 22:52|
154|torniojaws|Today Is the Day|As a reminder: later tonight we will play in Raahe at the Rytmikellari, and like mentioned we will record the show for a possible live album release. It all depends on how it sounds and if it works well ;) The setlist has evolved and some songs have changed for live renderings. We will also have some merchandise for sale at a nice price, to add one more good reason to show up ;)<br /><br />Now it's time to pack the necessary equipment up, so see you there!|2009-12-03 13:58|
155|torniojaws|Post show palaver|The show was nice and the recording was completed. Now we just have to decide if the show is good enough for an official release from the quality viewpoint and such. Maybe it will be released...|2009-12-05 11:28|
156|torniojaws|Raahe Live Industry!|Ok, we decided to release the Raahe gig recording! It won't be an "official" release, as I'm not all that happy about the playing, since we didn't have any monitors during the show :D Quite difficult to play when you don't hear anything :-q But anyway, it's mostly good so here you go!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.vortechmusic.com/raahelive">http://www.vortechmusic.com/raahelive</a><br /><br />The setlist was:<br /><br />1. The Awakening<br />2. Their Contract<br />3. Impulse<br />4. Shedding the Flesh<br />5. Biodroid Legions<br />6. Retribution<br />7. The New Creations<br />8. Evolutionary Project<br />9. Destined to Fall<br /><br />Enjoy!|2009-12-05 14:28|
157|torniojaws|Songwriting|While waiting for the album, here's a quick video about how I usually write songs :)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCcmrkfLNwg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCcmrkfLNwg</a><br /><br />It also features quick snippets from two new tracks, plus of course the raw material for a third one. Enjoy!|2009-12-20 14:37|
158|torniojaws|2010|The next year will be a bit special, not only with the new album coming out, but it is also the 10th anniversary of the band, so expect something special. Something I don't think has been done before by anyone, but it will be very cool ;)|2009-12-22 13:00|
159|torniojaws|Progress|Right now there's 11 full songs finished (47:29), with 2-3 more going to be done before I'll start to pick the songs for the album. It's coming together very nicely, and the songs are much more varied this time around. Should be an interesting album ;) More news once there things to report...|2010-01-20 16:19|
160|torniojaws|Heads up|There might be a gig coming up soon, if all goes well! Stay tuned!<br /><br /><b>Update:</b><br />Okay, the gig has been confirmed! We will play with <a href="http://synestesia.net">Synestesia</a> in Hevimesta in Oulu on wednesday 31 March! See you there, and there may be some new songs waiting for their live premiere! ;)|2010-03-01 22:08|
161|torniojaws|One more gig|Another show was just confirmed! On 7 July, we will play at Bar Koodi in Kemi with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ikuinenvaiva">Ikuinen vaiva</a>. See you there, too!|2010-03-30 05:31|
162|torniojaws|Nice gig|Last night was very nice in Oulu. A lot of people seemed to like the new song, Neurovirus, that we played live for the first time :) It was also a fun song to play, so I think it will be frequently heard during our gigs. The next gig will be in July, but perhaps there may be something before that. We might also play at Liminka again this summer, so stay tuned...|2010-04-01 08:07|
163|torniojaws|1 year of Posthumanism|The latest album has now been out for exactly one year, and so far it has been downloaded 1546 times through this website :) This summer, I will be able to make a professional CD-R pressing of the album for everyone to enjoy! And with just some song tweaks left, perhaps the next album will also be available for purchase in CD format right away from the release, sometime this year! |2010-04-16 04:23|
164|torniojaws|Gig change|Bar Koodi has cancelled the gig with Ikuinen Vaiva on 7 July (citing "style change"), but tentatively we will join Ikuinen Vaiva in Kuusamo on 17 July at Wanha Mestari. See you there instead! :)|2010-04-16 19:55|
165|torniojaws|Album #5|I'm sure you've been anxious for some news about it :) And this is the latest: I just finished demoing the last of the songs for the release! I now have a total of 13 full songs, clocking in at 55:06. The next step is to start making some changes to the songs, based on my ideas when listening to them. When all the changes are completed, I will once more listen to all the songs, even making an initial song list. When I'm happy with all the songs, it's time to start recording the album :)<br /><br />I will post an initial song-by-song, commenting on the style of each song tomorrow, so stay tuned!|2010-05-01 18:22|
166|torniojaws|Song by song for the next album|<b>Chaos Dimension</b><br />Thrash riffage with a build-up for the chaotic chorus. I think I once described the song as Arcturus goes Testament.<br /><br /><b>Charcoal Earth</b><br />Energetic opening, with a melancholic verse slightly in Need for Speed II soundtrack style. End-time song and mood.<br /><br /><b>Demon In the Circuitry</b><br />The first song that was finished. Quite dark and driving, with an uplifting slightly egyptian chorus. A hard-hitting electronic interlude.<br /><br /><b>Frozen Machine</b><br />High-speed black metal with lots of electronics. You can hear the demo version on our <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">Myspace</a> page. Maybe even slightly orchestral, but highly dark in the chorus.<br /><br /><b>Grains of Reality</b><br />Dark electro. Slightly ambient but very expressive. Ulver? Even darker. Will most likely be the album ending song.<br /><br /><b>Lost</b><br />Some more black metal, this time a bit more straightforward. Still some dark melodies and a bit of speed. The kick drums really take advantage of being a machine ;) Something like 364 bpm...<br /><br /><b>Neurovirus</b><br />The first song to be played live from the album. Kind of Meshuggah-ish. Electronics, low tuning and some tricks. A really fun song.<br /><br /><b>Pyre of Souls</b><br />Perhaps a small homage to mid-90's Waltari. It's actually made out of riffs that didn't fit the past two albums, but still sounded good. This time they did, when combined. Get your butt movin' and groovin'!<br /><br /><b>Shattered Cities</b><br />Very industrial, with sample-based drums and electro beats. Quite dark overall, part of this song was going to be in a fully drum & bass type of song. Eventually the song developed into this one. New Breed?<br /><br /><b>The Apocalypse</b><br />Very slow doom metal with synths and a piano. Haunting and eerie with a highly fitting title. Perhaps the last song on the album. <br /><br /><b>The Black Rite</b><br />Probably the album opening song. High-paced and energetic, with a nice mood. Very melodic chorus, with sudden black metal changes.<br /><br /><b>Unveiling the Future</b><br />Punk/Hardcore? With a slight blackish touch, ⭡ Zyklon, but really something I haven't heard before anywhere. No blastbeats! ;)<br /><br /><b>Wire Synapse</b><br />Slightly fast with more hardcore things and electronics. Maybe a little SYL-like chorus, but darker. A lot of space synths in Darkspace style.<br /><br /><br />Will the album be called "Devoid of Life", time will tell ;) The artwork has progressed well. Once all the changes are complete to the demo songs, it's time to select which songs will be on the album. Not all of them will be.|2010-05-02 15:30|
167|torniojaws|Neurovirus at Myspace|And to celebrate the finished demos, I uploaded Neurovirus' demo version to our Myspace page. Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal</a>|2010-05-02 15:45|
168|torniojaws|Preparing to record!|It's once again that time of the year ;) This week, I will prepare the projects for recording all the guitars and bass tracks. The recording will take place next week, after which it's time to start writing the remaining lyrics. During the preparation phase, I will make Guitar Pro tabs of the songs too, as usual. I will also post some pictures and progress reports of the session, so keep checking here once in a while this and next week!<br /><br />In total, 13 songs will be recorded, but two of them will not be on the album. The usual case of not fitting in with the structure. I'll see what will happen with them, maybe bonus tracks on the CD-R release (this summer!)...|2010-05-04 17:10|
169|torniojaws|Final tweaks|Okay, the songlist is starting to form up and with two more songs dropped, this album will be one mean and tight kicker! With the four songs dropped in favour of intensity, there might be a separate EP that features those four non-album tracks, since they're still quite good songs too.<br /><br />So far the album is looking to be like this:<br /><br />1. The Black Rite (4:13)<br />2. Neurovirus (3:21)<br />3. Unveiling the Future (3:42)<br />4. Shattered Cities (3:57)<br />5. Frozen Machine (4:02)<br />6. Lost (3:58)<br />7. Wire Synapse (3:58)<br />8. The Apocalypse (5:15)<br />9. Grains of Reality (5:44)<br /><br />38 minutes and 9 seconds in total. To the point with direct action ;)|2010-05-06 08:20|

175|torniojaws|Recording begins tomorrow|Alright, now that all 13 tracks (album + EP) have been processed and prepared, it's time to start recording them tomorrow! I will post videos in the same manner as during the preparation phase, so stay tuned for some more videos and song clips ;)|2010-05-17 17:36|
176|torniojaws|Studio Progress|The first step in recording is of course setting up the instruments and picking the sounds. So that's what I've been doing now. I finished adjusting the intonation, truss rod and tuning earlier today, and a while ago I picked the guitar tone for the album. The whole chain seems to be: Gtr -> Redeye -> Fireface 400 -> Poulin LeGion (VST preamp) -> Poulin LeCab -> DSS3 Mesa 4x12 impulses<br /><br />It's sounding monster and very tight, which should fit the album too ;) And not to leave you hanging, here's also a video from the tone sessions. Of course, you can't tell much from that, but at least you'll see how I did the picking and comparing. Have fun!<br /><br /><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/42lvyTGNeBM&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/42lvyTGNeBM&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object>|2010-05-20 11:49|
177|torniojaws|Teaser!|Just for the fun of it, I posted a compilation of demo teaser clips from the various songs on the upcoming album! Head on to Myspace to hear some sneak previews ;) Tomorrow, I will start to record the guitars and if the previous albums have been any indicators, it will take about 3 days. Then it's time for bass.... <br /><br />Enjoy! ;)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal">http://www.myspace.com/vortechmetal</a>|2010-05-25 23:44|
178|torniojaws|Guitar Recording|Okay, here's a little chart for you to follow the progress. When a song is [x] checked, the guitars for that song have been finished:<br /><br />[x] Frozen Machine<br />[x] Lost<br />[x] Neurovirus<br />[x] Shattered Cities<br />[x] The Apocalypse<br />[x] The Black Rite<br />[x] Unveiling the Future<br />[x] Demon In the Circuitry<br /><br />And another one for the EP tracks:<br /><br />[x] Chaos Dimension<br />[x] Charcoal Earth<br />[x] Pyre of Souls<br />[x] Wire Synapse|2010-05-26 14:22|
179|torniojaws|Bass Recording|Phew, all guitars have now been recorded! 12 songs, 4 rhythm guitar tracks each, and 2 or 4 lead guitar tracks each. That's was a lot of work :P Now it's time to start recording bass, which is always fun :)<br /><br />Maybe at some point I'll post some of those guitar recording videos, probably after some edits, because there's one video for almost every riff and lead :P|2010-06-08 13:31|
180|torniojaws|Progress with bass, preparing for vocals|Okay, I'm currently recording the bass tracks for the songs, and so far three songs have been finished. Once the bass is finished, I will also bounce the guitar and bass tracks, so that the song is ready for vocal recording and subsequent mixing. Each song will once again be listed below and I will check them once they're finished.<br /><br />As for vocals, I still don't have much in the way of lyrics - only one sketch of full lyrics for The Black Rite, and some lines here and there for the others. Matti has some lyrics for a few songs, so there's still a few more to finish. Once all the bass tracks are recorded and the songs prepared, I will start to concentrate on the lyrics. The idea is forming quite well for the theme of the album, but more on that later... meanwhile:<br /><br />Bass / Preparation<br /><br />[x] [x] Frozen Machine<br />[x] [x] Lost<br />[x] [x] Neurovirus<br />[x] [x] Shattered Cities<br />[x] [x] The Apocalypse<br />[x] [x] The Black Rite<br />[x] [x] Unveiling the Future<br />[x] [x] Demon In the Circuitry<br /><br />And for the EP:<br /><br />[x] [x] Chaos Dimension<br />[x] [x] Charcoal Earth<br />[x] [x] Pyre of Souls<br />[x] [x] Wire Synapse|2010-06-09 15:41|
181|torniojaws|Well, finished :D|Why wait until tomorrow when you can do it today...<br /><br />Start: 17:34<br />Finished: 22:24<br /><br />4 hours and 50 minutes to record all the bass guitars for the new album, plus bounce the tracks... not bad ;)<br /><br />Now it's time to start working on the vocals, and doing some initial test mixes.|2010-06-09 19:26|
182|torniojaws|Lyrics|Now it's time to work on the lyrics! This is, of course, a much slower process. But it shouldn't take too long, as I intend to have the album out before October. Hopefully much earlier, though :)<br /><br />[x] The Black Rite<br />[x] Neurovirus<br />[x] Shattered Cities<br />[x] Demon In the Circuitry<br />[x] Frozen Machine<br />[x] Lost<br />[x] Unveiling the Future<br />[x] The Apocalypse<br />[ ] Grains of Reality<br /><br />And another one for the EP tracks:<br /><br />[ ] Charcoal Earth<br />[ ] Chaos Dimension<br />[ ] Pyre of Souls<br />[ ] Wire Synapse|2010-06-16 13:35|
183|torniojaws|Some delays|Seems like I caught a sore throat, so recording the demo vocals has been delayed for a while (1-4 weeks). Meanwhile, I'll continue writing the remaining lyrics. Most of them are already finished, but I won't mark them in the list below until I have an mp3 with the demo vocals. I'll also rehearse for the upcoming gig in Rovaniemi, at Grande on 23 July.|2010-07-07 14:50|
184|torniojaws|Lyrics|The lyrics are now, for the most part, finished for the main release. The next step is to arrange them to suit the songs: the flow, the rhythm and so on. Once that is finished, we're ready to start recording them! But before that, we have a gig to prepare to, and you will hear three new songs at the show, plus two songs which we've never played live yet. So it will be a fun show with lots of new things. See you there! |2010-07-11 17:49|
185|torniojaws|Vocal recording|The schedule is starting to take form. If all goes well, the vocals for the next album will be recorded in the beginning of September! Hopefully the album will be in release form by October or November.|2010-08-17 13:11|
186|torniojaws|Vocals & Other|Matti has requested some more time to rehearse the vocals for the album, so the recording has been postponed for a while. So, meanwhile that will give me the opportunity to continue on the second little thing I've planned for the 10th anniversary of Vortech. It will be an album not like the normal anniversary compilation or re-recording, but something quite different indeed!<br /><br />What it is, is a complete reworking of many Vortech songs released so far. I have first chosen a selection of 16 tracks from the history of Vortech, and then I have decided a completely different music genre that I will use as a guideline for the remaking of each song :) In every case, completely different than what the original was. <br /><br />Once this special release is ready, you will hear, for example, a black metal version of Apoapsis Mentis, a lounge/orchestral version of Humanity: Static, a dubstep/industrial version of Evolutionary Project, a jazz version of Terra Ultimatum, drum & bass version of The Core, a dark ambient version of Biodroid Legions, and many many more equally interesting remakes! And maybe a few surprises too...<br /><br />And as a final bonus, here is a quick sneak preview on what is to come! ;) Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech/evoremix.mp3">Evolutionary Project (Debased World Order Remix by Vortech)</a>|2010-10-03 12:31|
187|torniojaws|Some more progress|I just finished a preliminary final mix for the new album, and it sounds very nice and raw (Recto, baby!). And that leaves just the vocals to be recorded, and then to import them in. The album will finish on the fly along with the vocals, so it might be quick!<br /><br />And also, I just finished making the first draft for the album artwork, so things are slowly falling into place for the release! Hopefully I will be able to make a professional CD-R release for both the new album, plus Posthumanism.|2010-10-15 22:17|
188|torniojaws|Meanwhile in Finland...|I just finished one long-term project that some of you might have been waiting for. Yes, the elusive Making of Posthumanism video! I'm currently uploading it to Youtube, so expect a link very soon :) 7,5 minutes of tight information! <br /><br />Here you go!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZV98hpwGCI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZV98hpwGCI</a>|2010-10-18 22:49|
189|torniojaws|Already looking to the future!|And in case you missed it at some point, there will also be a 4-song EP after the new album has been released. It will feature songs that were composed at the same time as the other songs on the new album, but didn't fit stylistically to the album. They're still great songs, so hence the extra EP ;) And as just a high-five to some long-term fans, and new ones too, here's a teaser clip on how one of those songs on the EP sounds like! Enjoy ;)<br /><br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/lecto_esim.mp3">lecto_esim.mp3</a><br /><br />Let the speculation start on which of the four songs that one is... hehe.|2010-10-23 22:36|

195|torniojaws|Vocals|While waiting for the main album vocals, I've been finishing up the lyrics and demo vocals for the EP songs. Mostly finished now, just some small tweaks to do :) Perhaps I'll try something different with them...|2010-12-13 23:25|
196|torniojaws|EP vocals|The lyrics have now been finished, and there's demo vocals on all tracks. Now it's time to record them! As with the songs, the lyrics and vocals are also slightly different from the main album.|2010-12-15 11:48|
197|torniojaws|EP vocals recorded!|Well, it took about 2 hours, and now they are finished, hehe. I chose to make my vocals in my most natural rough voice, which I find quite similar to Tomas Lindberg (At the Gates). Then there's some clean vocals that I recorded, but I will listen to them for a few days and decide if they're publishable or if I'll get someone else to sing them :)<br /><br />But anyway, if they're good, I will release the EP in a few days. And as a reminder, the EP will be quite different from the style of the main album! The album seems to slip to early 2011 though.|2010-12-17 22:29|
198|torniojaws|Infocalypse (EP) is out... now!|Just in time for a christmas blast, you can get the new EP from here:<br /><a href="http://www.vortechmusic.com/infocalypse">http://www.vortechmusic.com/infocalypse</a><br /><br />Here is the EP front cover (click for full size) and tracklist:<br /><br /><a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech/vortech_infoc_2010_full.jpg"><img src="http://koti.mbnet.fi/juhau/vortech/vortech_infoc_2010_400x400.jpg" alt="Infocalypse"/></a><br /><br />01. Chaos Dimension<br />02. Charcoal Earth<br />03. Pyre of Souls<br />04. Wire Synapse<br /><br />This is of course a preliminary release in preparation for the full length album coming out early next year. This EP features me doing everything for the first time since Conclusion, including vocals. Not in the Conclusion style, mind you. Check it out to hear ;)<br /><br />Enjoy!|2010-12-19 16:29|
199|torniojaws|Post-posthumanism|The album Posthumanism has now been downloaded over 2000 times through our website! :) And Deep Beneath is not too far behind. Each successive album seems to have higher and higher download counts, which is very good!<br /><br />The new EP has been downloaded over 150 times already, too! And everyone is of course waiting for the new full length release, which is still in the vocal recording phase. Hopefully it will be released soon!|2011-01-04 18:11|
200|torniojaws|First vocals received|I just received the first batch of vocals from Matti and I'll start to work on the mix very soon :) Once the process is well underway, there will probably be some clips for all to hear :) Despite all the hardware breakdowns, I'm sure this album will be out well before summer :)|2011-01-20 21:09|
201|torniojaws|Two songs mixed|Slowly but surely it's coming together! I've finished two mixes with Matti's vocals, and it's still sounding very good, especially the second mix! Some more songs left to record and then the album can be released! Taking a while, but for the best :)<br /><br />And of course, at this point I've already been looking forward, and the album after the upcoming one will be slightly different than the past two albums. But let's see how the final direction is like! I'm sure it will be more electronic overall.|2011-02-27 20:14|
202|torniojaws|Songwriting...|While waiting for the vocals for the upcoming album to be finished, I have already started to write songs for the album after the upcoming one, hehe. But hold your horses, the album I just started to write songs for is probably released sometime in 2012.<br /><br />You're probably curious what the 2012 album will sound like. Well, from the first songs and rough material, it is very different to Posthumanism and the 2011 album. Much more electronic and more ambient in general, but still with lots of guitars ;) We think three albums of blastbeats should do for the time being, so don't expect a lot (if any) of them on the 2012 album. The style is more futuristic, beat-oriented with industrial ambience.<br /><br />It's all very inspiring at the moment, so the 2012 album should progress well in the upcoming months :)|2011-04-02 20:22|
203|torniojaws|Progress on the 2012 album composing|So, right now there are two songs demoed and the idea for the full album seems to be forming up :) Very different from the previous, that's for sure! But even more twisted, heheh. Can't wait to have this released, it should prove to be a nice addition to the category of rare genres of music :)|2011-04-18 21:38|
204|torniojaws|Eerie silence... ends!|I was happy to hear that Matti will resume work on the vocals in a brand new studio built in hte premises of his other band. The latest progress report is that we should have the new album out in September! Let's hope things go well, and finally you can hear the new album in its entirety! I'm very thrilled to have it released, after a long time. As some might remember, the instrument tracks were recorded back in May 2010.|2011-07-15 12:39|
205|torniojaws|Hold your horses!|Ok, the release is not yet imminent, but let's see what happens. Meanwhile, I'm having a lot of more ideas for the next songs, and even the next-next album (2013? Maybe sooner). And the idea is that it will feature real drums! Yep, Ville will most likely take over the duties of a drum-human(?). So it will be with great anticipation we look forward with!<br /><br />But to sum it up:<br /><br />Late 2011(-ish): the current album, entitled Devoid of Life<br />Mid 2012: the electronic album<br />Sometime 2013: the album with human drums|2011-10-06 20:15|
206|torniojaws|Tweaks|Things are moving about in the backdrops, but let's see what the future holds.<br /><br />Meanwhile, another new demo song is ready! That brings the total to 5 tracks fully demoed and two more on the line... Interesting times indeed!|2012-01-19 22:00|
207|torniojaws|New songs, new things|Two more songs have been finished in demo form, which brings the current total to 7 songs and 25 minutes ready for the next (electronic with guitars) release. At this rate, the songs should be ready for recording before summer. Hopefully Devoid of Life will also be released before then - the vocals are progressing and the duties are handled by Mikko Nikula.|2012-02-19 09:23|
208|torniojaws|The Binary Hive|Surely you're dying to hear something from the future Vortech album, right? Well, you can die with the sneak demo version of one of the tracks that will be on the upcoming electronics-heavy Vortech release. Enjoy the Chronologic Disorder!

209|torniojaws|Backbones|This website is soon starting a long-overdue overhaul to improve some things and provide more content. There should also be some more social elements added and the guestbook will receive an update to allow unicode characters. The biography and such will also be updated to reflect the current status.<br /><br />The basic structure is already done, and now the eyes turn toward creating the content. There will be some extensive PHP additions, to make many things more handy, so it might take some time for them to be added. I will see later whether I will update the important content, and then add more things to the site as they become ready.<br /><br />But tune in later to see the new site! Hopefully by the end of this week. There should also be some updates on the new album, too...|2012-03-12 09:11|

216|torniojaws|New things|Another demo song done! That brings the total to 9 already, about 34 minutes of new material. I'll keep writing until there's 15 songs to choose from and then start thinking about song orders and what style of songs are still needed.<br /><br />It will be probably closer to the end of the year before we'll start recording though.|2012-05-10 12:09|

220|torniojaws|Two more demo songs finished!|That brings the total to 11 songs and 42 minutes. As mentioned, I will write 15 songs in total before we start to narrow them down for the release and doing the final tweaks for the songs. Then lyrics and recording, as usual. The album will most likely be out before the end of this year, so hold tight and enjoy Devoid of Life meanwhile :)<br /><br />I noticed I haven't officially shown any song titles, so here's the working titles of all the new songs. Some of the titles will probably change, but mostly these are the final ones:<br /><br />Chronologic Disorder<br />Corporate Machinery<br />Event Horizon<br />Hindrance of Existence<br />Kill Command<br />Mean Time to Failure<br />Mechanicide<br />Organic Gears<br />The Granules<br />Three-Step Oblivion<br />Transient Line|2012-06-17 21:40|

228|torniojaws|Current plans|Just a slight update once again on all things in progress:<br /><br />1) The new electronic metal album will have a couple of more demo songs done before it's time to start reviewing the material and choosing what songs will be on it. Recording it will be quite quick after that, since there's only guitars and vocals that need to be recorded live.<br /><br />2) The CD prints for Devoid of Life and Posthumanism. I just need to finish the preparation of the artwork and gather the funds for it, then I will send quote requests and then they should be ready within this year - depending on funds mostly. They will be printed CDs, instead of factory-made CD-R discs.<br /><br />3) The T-shirts for Devoid of Life will be ordered as soon as I get replies to the quote requests, and then we will decide which company we will use. The shirts should be quickly available after that, and they will be available for purchase through our website and hopefully some other places.<br /><br />4) Live shows and rehearsals. We will continue our rehearsals at least until we have a nice setlist working well, and then we will start looking forward to playing some concerts around Finland, and hopefully soon abroad too!<br /><br />5) The next Vortech band album. Of course being planned already! I already have some ideas for the style and such, and I'm sure many will be pleased to know it will be a really fast one, hehe. Scifi and all... For sure it will be ready by the end of 2013, but who knows maybe even earlier.<br /><br />6) We are also trying out some extra members for the band, although currently perhaps just for live shows. We'll see how things work out, and maybe we will have some full-time additions!<br /><br />7) Also some updates for the website will come in the near future, addressing some things that could work a bit differently, plus adding some more things!<br /><br />I guess that should cover most things for the time being :)|2012-08-20 08:56|

242|torniojaws|New year, new tricks, new stuff!|2013 will be a lucky one for you fans of Vortech, as there will be possibly two albums out this year, to make up for the lost year of 2011, hehe.<br /><br />In the first half of 2013, we will release the new electronic metal album, of which several sample songs have already been published. But don't be too complacent yet, as the most exciting tracks are still kept in secret! :)<br /><br />And the second album will be started as soon as there's time. The second album will be back to the familiar Vortech-ground of extreme metal infused with an industrial edge! If all goes well, look forward to the end of the year for the first tasters! If not even the finished thing :)<br /><br />Have a great 2013!|2013-01-02 21:11|

248|torniojaws|The Electronic Front!|We are now ready with writing new songs for the next Vortech album! Altogether, there's 18 new songs, clocking in at 1 hour 11 minutes 50 seconds! As mentioned, this album is highly electronic/industrial-oriented in the approach and expands the palette of Vortech to whole new levels!<br /><br />I've always likened the style of Vortech as a triangle where each corner has one of the three aspects: 1) Extreme Metal, 2) Industrial and Electronic, and 3) Progressive. Looking back, Deep Beneath leaned a lot towards the Progressive corner, while for example Posthumanism was in the Extreme corner along with Wasteland. This brand new album will be a case where the flag is hoisted firmly in the Industrial and Electronic corner.<br /><br />We will also work on a second album this year, which will be in the more familiar Vortech grounds of Industrial Death Metal. But at the moment, the full effort is given for this electronic metal album, which has the working title "The Binary Hive". We will now begin to go through the songs to pick a suitable tracklist and do any adjustments to the songs if needed. The lyrics will also be written during this time, and once everythings ready, we will start to record the album!<br /><br />That's it for the mean time!<br />- Juha|2013-03-09 17:20|
249|torniojaws|Forking a maze in|The tracklist is progressing quite well. The method I use this time is to pick a song that starts the album, and then find which song works the best following the previous song. If there are multiple very good followers, I fork the list. Then I'll just listen which of the lists works the best.|2013-03-10 09:26|
250|torniojaws|Practice makes perfect|We just had a three-day streak of rehearsals, which is quite nice! The songs practiced will be on our live set, and possibly we will have a show or two sometime soon! Altogether there are 13 songs in the list, allowing us to play up to one hour, which is nice ;)|2013-03-29 10:32|
251|torniojaws|Fulltime lyrics generation|The lyrics for the next album are well underway, with about 70% of them ready for demo vocals! Once the lyrics are done and demoed, it's time to start recording the album! Much work has been done to make sure it's as streamlined and complete as possible, with a few songs appearing in another context.. More news on that later!|2013-04-11 13:21|
252|torniojaws|Lyrics soon done!|Just some finalization left to do, and then the lyrics are finally done for the next release!|2013-05-14 16:57|
253|torniojaws|Finalizing phase before recording starts|One song left to do lyrics for! Overall, the lyrics are mixture of something familiar and something abstract. You should find them very nice and cozy to paint a dystopian mental picture with, hehe. This time around, the themes are centered slightly further in the future, where things are different in many ways. Neon lights reflecting from pouring rain puddles on sleek steel, destroyed in long-past conflicts.<br /><br />I have also started working on the Guitar Pro tabs for the songs, so all you guitar slingers can have a go at the songs! Perhaps I will do some instruction videos too. As the songs have quite a bit of new tricks, in terms of Vortech, there should be some nice revelations to be found when checking the tabs! Look forward to the tabs on our updated website, published with the release of the album!<br /><br />Anyway, the next point on the schedule is recording the demo vocals. A very important thing to do, as you would expect. After doing the demos, we will check how the lyrics work with the phrasing and such, and if something needs to be adjusted before recording the real vocals. Once the demo vocals are done, it is time to begin recording album number 6...|2013-05-22 08:29|
254|torniojaws|Tabs done! Commence demo vocals...|All the guitar tablatures have now been completed! 18 songs in an easy format to learn from! So, that leads the way to recording the demo vocals, which will serve as a guideline for the final vocals. Once they are done, I will begin recording the final guitars for the new album!|2013-06-02 13:10|
255|torniojaws|Demo vocals in progress|So far four songs have fully completed demo vocals done. That leaves 10 songs left to do for me, and 4 songs for Mikko. The 4 songs are the songs Mikko wrote lyrics for. Should be interesting to hear what he came up with! Tomorrow I will continue recording more demo vocals, with hopefully 5 more songs receiving the demo effect :P|2013-06-04 19:44|
256|torniojaws|It is time to start recording the album!|All demo vocals are now ready, and that of course means it is time to start recording the album! Given the nature of the songs, it should prove to be a quick endeavour! Hang tight and check our <a href="https://twitter.com/VortechMetal">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vortechmetal">Facebook</a>, or this website to catch the latest news!<br /><br />Altogether there are 18 songs to be recorded, of which 14 will be on the album and the remaining four will be on an EP. Both will be released around the same time, so you'll have a nice year with Vortech! The release date depends on how quickly we can conclude the recording and finish the mixing, but usually they have not taken too long...<br /><br />Stay tuned for more info about the album name and titles.|2013-06-08 08:54|

258|torniojaws|Instrument recordings almost complete!|Today has been highly productive, as the instruments to almost all the songs on the upcoming album have been recorded! In just 14 hours, 18 songs - that's gotta be some kind of a record, hehe. Especially with quad tracked rhythm guitars + leads included... perhaps the album should be re-titled to Darkthrone? ;)|2013-06-21 22:14|
259|torniojaws|Well, the instruments are now done!|All instruments have now been recorded for the next album and next EP! Altogether 18 songs, completely finished in 15,5 hours hehe :) Now, the next step will be to record all the vocals with Mikko. Hopefully in July, and perhaps by September we will have something new for all the fans!|2013-06-21 23:32|
260|torniojaws|Consolidate the Progress|I'm almost finished with the consolidation of the projects, in preparation for the mixing phase. Mikko is also rehearsing at the moment, so we will start recording the vocals quite soon!|2013-06-29 08:12|
261|torniojaws|Starting to mix!|We have now reached the moment to start doing some test mixes! Only the vocals remain to be recorded, and the recording sessions will start next week, if all goes well! Meanwhile I will start to make some initial test mixes and look for the suitable guitar tones and overall sound for the album!<br /><br />Shouldn't take too long, now...|2013-07-29 15:41|
262|torniojaws|Vocal recording has started!|Starting from today, Mikko has become busy with recording the vocals for the upcoming album, The Occlusion, with Teemu Miinala, who also recorded the drums and vocals for our previous release Devoid of Life! The recording session will first concentrate on the full length album, after which the vocals for the accompanying EP will be recorded.<br /><br />Can't wait to hear the results :)|2013-08-03 15:35|
